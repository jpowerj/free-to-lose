The worker is exploited because the consumption bundle she can
purchase with her wage embodies less labor than she expended, and
the capitalist is an exploiter because the goods he can purchase with
his profits (or the goods that accrue to him as profits) embody more
labor than he expended. Even if the capitalist works hard, this will
usually be the case.
Why is this accounting of socially embodied labor against labor
expended interesting? And to what uses might one put measurements
of exploitation? Marxists use exploitation as a statistic for both
positive and normative ends. In its positive use, the exploitation of
workers is said to explain profits. In its normative use, exploitation is
said to indicate unjust treatment of workers by capitalists. In this
chapter, I will begin an evaluation of the usefulness of exploitation as
a statistic in these roles.
5.1 Exploitation as the Source of Profits
The "fundamental Marxian theorem" (Theorem 4.1) provides the basis
for the claim that the exploitation of workers is the condition that
explains profits. Although Marx did not prove this theorem in the
way it has been presented here, he did reach the conclusions embodied
in the theorem, and he believed that he had uncovered the
explanation of how profits could emerge in a system of noncoercive
exchanges where, on every market, equal value exchanges for equal
value. Under the hypothesis of the ubiquitous exchange of equals on
competitive markets, how could a surplus systematically emerge in
The Morality of Exploitation 53
the hands of capitalists? Only if, Marx thought, there is a commodity
or factor capable of contributing more value in the production process
than it itself had. Marx argued that labor power is that commodity.
The worker receives as a daily wage an amount of corn that costs less,
in terms of labor, than the amount of labor the worker can expend in a
day. The commodity sold by the worker and purchased by the capitalist
is labor power-the capacity to perform labor-and a day's labor
power can release more labor than is embodied in the goods necessary
to reproduce that labor power. This is the source of profits and,
Marx believed, uniquely so.
I have assigned to labor power the "property of exploitability,"
because one unit of it can be socially reproduced with less than one
unit of labor. Labor power, however, is not the only productive factor
that possesses the property of exploitability. I could, in fact, take corn
as the numeraire commodity with respect to which embodied values
should be defined. Consider the economy of Chapter 4, in which the
technology for producing corn is {a,L} and the subsistence bundle per
day of labor is b. How much corn is embodied in a unit of corn? To
produce 1 unit of corn requires the planting of a units of seed, and it
requires the consumption of bL units of corn by the laborer to produce
the labor used as an input in the corn production process. The total
amount of corn embodied in 1 unit of corn is therefore a + bL. I noted
that the necessary and sufficient condition for profits to exist is that
a + bL < 1.
But this is precisely the statement that 1 unit of corn be socially
reproduced with less than 1 unit of corn. That is, corn possesses the
property of exploitability as well. Indeed, a necessary and sufficient
condition for the existence of profits is that corn possess the property
of exploitability.
This statement generalizes to an economy with n goods. One can
adopt any good as the value numeraire and prove a Generalized
Commodity Exploitation Theorem, which states that profits exist if
and only if each produced commodity possesses the property of exploitability
when it is taken as the numeraire for calculating embodied
value. This conclusion is not surprising, because the rate of exploitability
can be viewed as a measure of the productive efficiency of a
factor. The rate of exploitability of labor power is the ratio of the surplus
labor that can be squeezed out of a unit of labor power to the amount
of labor required to reproduce that unit from a social point of view.
54 The Morality of Exploitation
The corn rate of exploitability is the ratio of the surplus com that can be
squeezed out of a unit of com to the amount of com required to
reproduce that unit of com. Every produced commodity used in production
must be capable of giving up such a surplus, when measured
this way, for any social net surplus (that is, profits) to be forthcoming.
Marx was wrong in thinking that he had discovered the unique
source of profits in the exploitability of labor power. What distinguishes
the exploitability of labor power from that of com? One identifies
the exploitability of labor power with the exploitation of the
worker. Some have argued that the exploitability of labor power is
different because the extraction of labor from labor power can only be
performed with the conscious and cooperative participation of the
worker, whereas the productive powers of com can be harnessed
without such intimate participation of a human agent. The capitalist
must design ways of organizing the manufacturing process to ensure
that the worker works-methods of supervision, technologies that
lend themselves to controlling the rate of labor extraction (such as
assembly lines), and methods of reward that either give workers the
right incentives or constrain them in ways that assure that labor will
be forthcoming. But, if labor and com differ by virtue of the ability of
workers to resist providing labor, that difference is not elucidated by
looking at rates of exploitation. One should, instead, study the methods
capitalists have used to extract labor, as Marxist social science has
done. The seminal work in this area of recent years is the book by
Braverman (1974).
5.2 The Initial Distribution
If the exploitation of the worker is an important concept, it is so for
normative reasons-because it is indicative of some injustice and not
because the exploitability of labor power is the unique source of
profits. In the model in Section 2.3, exploitation emerged because of
the inequality of ownership of the capital stock. If the exploitation of
the worker seems unfair, it is because one thinks the initial distribution
of capital stock, which gives rise to it, is unfair.
I will elucidate this claim. Imagine the following situation, in which
exploitation emerges as a consequence of an initial distribution of
resources that one thinks of as fair. (Note that I use the term exploitation
in its technical sense throughout this chapter.) Suppose that there
The Morality of Exploitation 55
are two agents, Adam and Karl. They have different preferences for
com and leisure and will live for many weeks. Assume that a week is
the length of time required for com to grow and that Karl and Adam
have available the same technologies used in the models of Chapter 2:
Farm
Factory
3 days labor
1 day labor
+ 1 unit of corn
--+ 1 unit of com
--+ 2 units of corn, gross
Adam and Karl each start with 112 unit of com. Karl is highly averse to
performing work in the present: he desires only to consume 1 unit of
com per week, subject to the requirement that he not run down his
seed stock. In the first week, he therefore works 112 day in the Factory
(fully utilizing his seed com) and l 11z days on the Farm, producing a
total of 1112 units of com, 1 of which he consumes at harvest time,
leaving him with liz unit to start with in week 2. Adam accumulates
during the first week; he works 112 day in the Factory, utilizing his
seed com, and 4112 days on the Farm, producing 2Vz units of com,
gross. After consuming 1 unit of com, he has IVz units left with
which to start week 2. In week 2, Karl works up his own seed stock in
Vz day in the Factory, producing 1 unit of com; then, instead of going
to the Farm, Karl borrows or rents Adam's 1112 units of seed com and
works it up in the Factory. This takes Karl precisely 1112 days and he
produces 3 units of com, gross, in the process. Of the 3 units of com,
he keeps Vz unit of com and returns 2112 units of com to Adam
(Adam's principal of IVz units of com plus interest of 1 unit of com).
Indeed, Karl is quite content with this arrangement, for he has
worked for a total of 2 days and received 1112 units of com, just as in
week I, when he had to use the inferior Farm technology. This means
the rate of interest that Adam has charged him (66.6%) is just the rate
at which he is indifferent between borrowing from Adam and working
on the Farm. (One can see that if there are many people like Karl
and only a few like Adam, then competition will drive the interest
rate to this value. Thus, the competitors for access to Adam's capital
will have bid away any advantage they might have derived from
borrowing from Adam rather than working on the Farm. The equilibrium
interest rate is the competitive interest rate in a world where
there are many people with Karl's preferences and relatively few with
Adam's.) Adam, on the other hand, receives a profit of 1 unit of com
from Karl's labor, which he consumes, and is left again to begin week
56 The Morality of Exploitation
3 with 1 V2 units of corn. He has not worked at all in week 2. This
arrangement can continue forever, with Karl working 2 days and
consuming 1 unit of corn each week, and Adam consuming 1 unit of
corn each week but working 5 days during the first week and 0 days
thereafter (Table 5.1).
Clearly there is exploitation in all weeks after the first in this arrangement.
Adam does not work but lives off the interest he receives
from lending his capital to Karl. Alternatively, I could have had Adam
hire Karl to work on his capital stock in the Factory, paying him a
wage of V3 unit of corn per day. The interest rate, like the wage that
Karl will settle for, is determined by his next best opportunity on the
Farm, and if there are many Karls and a few Adams, the competitive
wage is V3 unit of corn per day.
But is there anything wrong with this exploitation? Karl and Adam
(or the Karls and the Adams) started out with equal endowments of
corn. Is there any sense in which Adam has taken unfair advantage of
Karl? None is apparent, unless one views Karl's preference for leisure
today as a kind of handicap, which gives him the right to some kind
of protection from Adam's offer. Or, perhaps, Karl (but not Adam)
was incapatitated in some way and thereby prevented from working
more than 3 days a week. In this case one might decide that they
faced unequal opportunities at the beginning, which would surely
prejudice the judgment that the outcome was fair.
Karl is said to have a high rate of time preference, as he is relatively
unwilling to forestall present consumption for the sake of greater
consumption in the future. Adam has a low rate of time preference.
In this case, the commodity whose consumption over time is at issue
is leisure. Suppose Karl's high rate of time preference is due to impa-

3 0 2 1
4 0 2 1
The Morality of Exploitation 57
tience rather than to some physical handicap that prevents him from
working as long as Adam does during the first week. If one were to
forbid transactions of lending or hiring between Adam and Karl, then
Karl still would be no better off (he would continue to work, as he did
in week 1, in both Factory and Farm for a total of 2 days to produce
his 1 unit of corn, net), but Adam would be worse off. Would it not,
therefore, be spiteful to forbid these trades between them? Forbidding
these transactions would only give rise to a Pareto suboptimal
allocation of streams of corn and leisure over the lives of Adam and
Karl. If Adam could not deal with Karl, then he would have to work
every period himself, while Karl would work no less. Now supposeto
make the argument stronger-that there are set-up costs in moving
from the Factory to the Farm. Then, when Karl works in both places,
as in week 1, he would have to expend more than 2 days of labor to
get 1 unit of corn. In week 2, when he borrows from Adam, he uses
only the Factory, and so he works just the 2 days. Thus, with set-up
costs, both Karl and Adam strictly gain by virtue of Adam's accumulation
in week 1. (It is not clear precisely how the interest rate would
be set when set-up costs exist, but that is a matter of second-order
concern.) For a socialist society to prevent such exploitation, it
"would have to forbid capitalist acts between consenting adults" (Nozick,
1974, p. 163).
There may be reasons to forbid such transactions, but they are not
visible at the level of simplicity of this model. Yet even at this level
exploitation unquestionably obtains. The conclusion to be drawn
from the example, then, is this: when exploitation is an injustice, it is
not because it is exploitation as such, but because the distribution of
labor expended and income received in an exploitative situation are
consequences of an initial distribution of assets that is unjust. The
injustice of an exploitative allocation depends upon the injustice of
the initial distribution. In the example, the initial distribution of equal
seed corn endowment was taken to be just, and I was consequently
hard put to identify the ensuing exploitation as evidence of anything
nasty.
What, then, might be the causes of a highly unequal initial distribution
of the means of production, and what are our attitudes toward
such causes? Should the exploitation that will arise from an unequal
distribution, variously caused, in a system of private property be
considered morally bad?
58 The Morality of Exploitation
5.2.1 Robbery and Plunder
If the initial distribution is highly unequal because some agents
robbed and plundered, then clearly there are grounds for viewing the
ensuing exploitation as bad. This is the case Marx made against European
capitalism, particularly English capitalism. Part VIII of the first
volume of Capital is entitled "The So-Called Primitive Accumulation."
In this section Marx relates the history of the concentration of wealth
by the English gentry through the enclosure movement and other
forms of robbery~ The appropriate folk rhyme, popular at the time is
(Cheyney, 1923, p. 188):
The law locks up the man or woman
Who steals the goose from off the common,
But leaves the greater villain loose
Who steals the common from the goose.
The unequal distribution of land that the enclosure movement accomplished
not only created a wealthy class but also created a potential
proletariat by disenfranchising peasants of all means of production
except their labor power. Before the enclosure movement the
yeoman peasant had access to the commons and a small herd, and
perhaps a small plot of land of his own; therefore, he had no need to
sell his labor power to survive. The enclosure movement made it
impossible for large numbers of disenfranchised peasants to survive
without selling labor power. Thus, proletarianization of a population
is often a by-product, intended or otherwise, of the concentration of
land or capital. The newly formed class of propertied agents thus
becomes wealthy, not only by virtue of the land it has acquired, but
also because, in the process of that acquisition, it has "liberated" a
mass of producers from their means of production, thus making them
available as a labor force for hire. Without the existence of a class
willing to sell its labor power (or to be enslaved or enserfed), large
land holdings would do their owners no good.
In the Marxist account, the enclosure movement in England was a
clear case of robbery and plunder, although that interpretation is not
unchallenged. A contemporary analogue to enclosure was accomplished
in the mid-twentieth century by the green revolution, during
which new varieties of seed (for example, wheat) that were vastly
more productive than old varieties were developed. Use of the new
seed, however, required capital investment in irrigation, insecticides,
The Morality of Exploitation 59
and fertilizers (as well as knowledge), which small peasants could not
undertake. Large landholders, by virtue of their wealth, were able to
make the transition to the new technology, which created an increase
in wheat yield and a decrease in the price of wheat. Small peasants
who had survived by selling wheat on the market could no longer
survive under these competitive pressures. They had to sell their land
and become either landless laborers or urban proletarians. (The
amount they could get for their small plots was too little to enable
them to become petty capitalists, in part because the big landlord to
whom a peasant sold his land was in a monopsonistic position.) It is
argued that this process of proletarianization contributed to the rapid
growth of Mexico City and the massive unemployment accompanying
it. Even though the long-term consequence of technological
change has been to increase the income of society, including that of
its proletarians, in the short-run technological changes of certain
kinds, like the green revolution, can proletarianize large masses of
people, who become unemployed and poor. This example is not preciselya
case of robbery or plunder, but it underscores the point that
the concentration of capital (a process leading to unequal distribution
of capital) is often accompanied by the proletarianization of a mass of
people, and, hence, benefits the propertied class in a double sense.
(For further discussion of the green revolution, see the book by
Hewitt de Alcantara [1976].)
It is often difficult to decide when an act that leads to the concentration
of wealth constitutes robbery. When the American Indians voluntarily
agreed to sell Manhattan Island to the Dutch for $24, was that
robbery? One might argue that if full information concerning a trader's
alternatives is not available, then the trade is immoral, with one
side taking unfair advantage of the other. Fairness involves not simply
a gain to both sides from a trade but also an equitable division of
the gains.
Most historical episodes of rapid concentration of land in the hands
of a few are accomplished either by direct force or at least by deals in
which political power is used in unprincipled ways. The history of
capitalism is replete with examples of the accumulation of wealth
through clearly unethical means, so it is not very difficult, on these
grounds, to condemn the present distribution of wealth. But the
question I am investigating is whether all possible causes of an unequal
distribution of capital are condemnable.
60 The Morality of Exploitation
5.2.2 Differential Rates of Time Preference
If agents have differential rates of time preference, then exploitation
will quickly be generated, as it was in the story of Karl and Adam.
Whether one views such exploitation as bad depends upon the view
one takes toward the genesis of the different rates of time preference
of these agents. Suppose the different rates came about as a consequence
of exposure to different environments-say, families with
different habits and different wealths. Adam, with a low rate of time
preference, learned to save because he grew up in a well-off family
that taught him the virtues of delayed gratification, whereas Karl's
impatient preferences are the consequence of never having been
taught by his parents to think about tomorrow. Perhaps, in such a
situation, one could say that the differential rates of time preference
that brought about the exploitation were themselves the consequence
of a prior injustice-the different wealths of Karl's and Adam's families,
which gave rise to their attitudes. More generally, the different
attitudes toward saving of Karl and Adam may be the consequence of
different external opportunities that one deems to be unfair.
Suppose, on the other hand, that Karl's and Adam's external opportunities
were identical but that they were born with different rates
of time preference. To condemn the ensuing exploitation, in this case,
involves construing a high rate of time preference as a handicap.
(This is the kind of value judgment that economists are loath to
make.) Even if Karl's rate of time preference is so high that he does
not take proper care of himself, does one have some objective basis
for interfering with the deals he might make? (One might want to
interfere because Karl's behavior eventually imposes costs on the
minimally benevolent society that insists upon hospitalizing him, and
paying for it, when he deteriorates as a result of his own neglect. But
that is an issue quite different from the one of exploitation, which I
am currently discussing.)
Suppose that Karl and Adam have different rates of time preference
because of their prior exposure to different external opportunities. It
is not necessarily the case that the preferences either one of them has
are irrational. In fact, it may be that their rates of time preference are
adapted to the environments in which they expect to live. Suppose
that there are many Karls, each of whom expects to live only two
weeks, and a small number of Adams, each of whom expects to live
for many weeks. Except insofar as their different expectations about
The Morality of Exploitation 61
the lengths of their lives may influence their choices, the Karls and
Adams all have the same attitudes about consumption of com and
leisure over time. If a Karl only expects to live two weeks, it is rational
for him to enjoy life this week, as well as next week; and so he
chooses to work, each week, just long enough to produce his subsistence
requirement (and not run down his stock of corn, which he
wants to pass on to his child, who will survive him). An Adam,
however, is willing to work exceedingly hard during the first week,
knowing that he can reap the benefits of leisure postponed to later
periods by hiring the Karl types, an option that Karl does not have.
Hence, to say that Karl and Adam have different rates of time preference
by virtue of their different environments does not imply that one
of them is behaving irrationally-against his self-interest, calculated
by his best estimate. Each chooses a pattern of work and consumption
based on his life expectancy. In this case, one might have
grounds to condemn the exploitation of Karl by Adam, not because of
the exploitation as such, but because the cause of their differential life
expectancies may be proximately related to an injustice. One cannot,
in this example, say that the cause of Karl's low life expectancy is his
poverty, because by assumption Karl and Adam each began with the
same wealth in com. But perhaps Karl came from a poor family or a
poor country (whereas Adam did not) and his attitudes about life
expectancy were formed in that environment.
It might seem silly to discuss these possibilities, but an important
justification for capitalism, which Marx attacked, was the theory that
capital was the reward for abstinence from consumption: some people
abstain from present consumption and provide a benefit to everyone
as a consequence, as does Adam in the example. The "surplus
labor" that others perform is the premium they pay to those who
provide the socially useful function of abstinence from present consumption
of leisure or com, which produces a capital stock for tomorrow.
Marx's answer to the abstinence defense of capitalist inequality
was that the primitive accumulation of capital did not come about that
way. Doubtless that is true. The original capitalists, by and large,
both saved and consumed at prodigious rates. Nevertheless, even in
modem capitalism, it is quite dear that some people become moderately
well-off by virtue of extremely hard but unskilled work, such as
small shopkeepers who are willing to work 80 to 90 hours a week. The
argument, for example, is made that in England East Indians are
willing to set up shops and work those hours; eventually, they be62
The Morality of Exploitation
come moderately well-off, in consequence of having chosen a path
the native English worker is unwilling to take, even though the capital
requirements and skills are within his means. East Indian immigrants
have created, for the first time, a British dream.
Although one does observe different rates of time preference, it is a
mistake to consider those differences to be a consequence of autonomous
choices that people have made. Neoclassical economists tend to
treat the rate of time preference as an aspect of a person's nature,
something that the person should therefore bear the consequences of.
But I think this is a myopic view. Attitudes toward saving are shaped
by culture, and cultures are formed by the objective conditions that
their populations face. If the East Indians work hard and build up
small businesses while the native British workers do not, then that
outcome is due to the history of the societies in which those populations
formerly lived, societies that inculcated them with different values.
Their differential success in capitalist enterprise is itself a consequence
of past experience with capitalism, which in the one case
demoralized the worker and in the other engendered in him a certain
degree of ambition. When one sees patterns of behavior that characterize
whole populations or classes, one must look for factors of social
origin. If there is very little movement out of the working class in
Britain, but more in the United States, that difference is due not to an
innate enterprising spirit among American workers but to the differences
between institutions and cultures in the two countries.
Marxists and left-liberals view rates of time preference as socially
determined. Therefore in their view it is not possible to justify exploitation
and inequality by appealing to differential rates of time preference,
for those differences arose from prior conditions of inequality
and oppression. Conservatives generally view the rate of time preference
as innate. But even if one grants that the trait is innate, it does
not follow that a person should bear the responsibility for that trait. In
the 1960s, a number of conservative writers, such as Arthur Jensen
and Richard Herrnstein, argued that blacks were innately inferior to
whites, as measured by IQ tests, and that a high rate of time preference
was linked to low intelligence. The evidence for an innate difference
in IQs between blacks and whites has now been thoroughly
discredited, but in the mid-1980s a new version of the argument
surfaced. James Q. Wilson and Richard Herrnstein argue that the
consumption of tobacco and alcohol by poor and, particularly, black
pregnant women creates brain damage in fetuses and results in a
The Morality of Exploitation 63
population of black children who lack the capacity to think about
tomorrow. In their provocatively titled book, Crime and Human Nature,
they claim that much inner city crime is explained by this population
of black youth with pathologically high rates of time preference.
The evidence for this position has been sharply challenged by
Leon Kamin, the same psychologist who exposed the concocted data
that was used to advance the racist IQ theories of the 1960s.
Thus, ideological positions are fought over in an apparently scientific
way. The origin of differential rates of time preference is an
important case in point, because the view that wealth is a return to
abstinence and saving has a long history. If people can be shown to
"deserve" their rates of time preference, perhaps because a preference
for planning and saving is a constituent of a person's personality
or character, then an argument will have been established to justify
inequality. It is important to recall the structure of the counterargument.
First, the initial conditions of differential ownership were established,
in all capitalist societies, by processes of theft and brute
power. Second, to the extent that people do have different rates of
time preference, and succeed differentially in capitalist society on that
account, those differences are largely due to the process by which
they are formed, namely, as a reaction to conditions of inequality and
oppression. It is incorrect to argue that differential rates of time preference
are the primal cause of unequal wealths if the genesis of those
differences is due to a prior history of inequality. Third, even if there
are some genetic or innate differences in rates of time preference,
why should people benefit or lose on that account? If having a high
rate of time preference is a handicap in a society with minimal social
insurance, then should not those with that handicap receive social
compensation?
5.2.3 Entrepreneurship
It is often argued in defense of capitalist inequality that profits are a
return to entrepreneurial ability. People with this ability see ways of
organizing labor and producing commodities that others do not see,
and this scarce factor is rewarded with profits. Entrepreneurial ability
plays the role in this explanation that a low rate of time preference
played in the explanation in Section 5.2.2. Two questions concerning
entrepreneurial ability can be raised: Is it a factor that is necessarily
scarce, or is it scarce because most people in a capitalist system do not
64 The Morality of Exploitation
have the opportunities to develop their entrepreneurial abilities?
Even if entrepreneurial ability is really scarce, is it appropriate for it to
be rewarded as it is, with the accumulation of capital? I cannot answer
the first question. With respect to the second, the argument can be
made that entrepreneurs will continue to exercise their scarce talents
even without the tremendous rewards that accrue to them in a capitalist
system, so the capital stock that they (under assumption) accumulate
need not be personally accumulated by them in order for their
talents to be available to society. Perhaps the salary society would
have to pay an entrepreneur is considerably less than he gets in a free
enterprise system. By virtue of the private property rights, the entrepreneur
who organizes and hires other factors of production is the
claimant who gets what is left after wages and other costs are paid.
But one can argue that a good part of that residual is a surplus that the
entrepreneur neither needs (to perform his productive function) nor
is entitled to.
Why might he not be entitled to it? Because his entrepreneurial skill
could be considered to be the consequence of environmental or genetic
factors from which he does not deserve to benefit. Suppose, to
invoke an example already given, he acquired those entrepreneurial
skills by virtue of growing up in a family in which he learned them by
example. The proletarian had no such luck. The advantage accruing
to the entrepreneur over that accruing to the proletarian is then a
consequence of an unequal opportunity and is perhaps one a society
committed to equality of opportunity should not condone. Granted,
the entrepreneur performs a socially beneficial function, but in this
case he should be paid only what is required to get him to do so.
Indeed, various capitalist societies do take this position to different
degrees, because they tax profits and managerial salaries at very different
rates. In Japan the managers of big corporations are paid much
less than their counterparts in the United States. But apparently they
perform their entrepreneurial and organizational functions at least as
well. Some argue that managers are not entrepreneurs but hired labor.
But many entrepreneurial functions are performed by managers,
and the popular justification of high managerial salaries in the United
States is based on a belief in the scarcity of entrepreneurial talent.
Suppose that entrepreneurs do not learn their talents but are born
with them, or, more realistically, that some people are born with the
capacity to acquire entrepreneurial skills and others are not. In this
case, people face different opportunities, but of a genetic sort. There
The Morality of Exploitation 65
may appear to be more reason to allow these natural entrepreneurs to
keep the capital they accumulate, if one holds to a principle of selfownership,
which claims that a person ought to be entitled to the
income that can be earned by the traits coming with his person. This
principle can be challenged. First, do not such genetic dispositions
constitute unequal opportunities, and what is our attitude toward
such inequality? Perhaps the entrepreneur will derive sufficient pleasure
from exercising his entrepreneurship, a pleasure unexperienced
by the ordinary person, to draw forth his scarce talent. Is it necessarily
the case that he should be repaid, as well, with the accumulation
of a large capital stock? Even if one endorses self-ownership, it does
not obviously require that degree of accumulation. Second, the entrepreneur
may be perfectly willing to exercise his organizational talent
without the accumulation of capital that attends its exercise under
capitalism. In that case, there would be no reason from a social point
of view to reward him in this way.
Thus far, I have taken the position that entrepreneurship is a talent.
In reality, much of that "talent" may consist in having the right connections,
something that is clearly associated with growing up with a
certain class background. There may be an element of the feudal lord
in the modem entrepreneur: somebody has to be one, but almost
anyone could be, and so the positions go to those with family connections.
Joseph Schumpeter argued that in early capitalism entrepreneurship
was scarce and that capitalism served the function of bringing
it to the fore. But now the requisite entrepreneurial skill can be
taught to managers of socialist enterprises in business schools. It is
available to many, regardless of connections and background.
Neoclassical economists tend to argue, in various ways, that each
factor receives its appropriate return. Sometimes, in cruder versions
of the neoclassical theory, appropriate return is translated as "just
return." But, usually, appropriate return is taken to mean "that return
required to make the factor contribute its services." This hardly
seems to be the case, however, given the large variation in remuneration
to talent that exists in different capitalist societies. The Marxist
position is that each factor requires some remuneration to be reproduced
and for it to be offered for productive service. What is left over
after the payment of these necessary remunerations is an economic
surplus, and there is considerable leeway in the manner in which
society may distribute this surplus. In a laissez-faire system, there is
some bargaining over the surplus (between workers and capitalists,
66 The Morality of Exploitation
for example), but there is no guarantee that the agreement reached is
just or that it reflects a socially necessary pattern of remuneration.
Thus, one need not deny the existence of a scarce talent called entrepreneurship
to deny the justice of the vast inequalities that may be
attributable to it in a capitalist system. Moreover, it is incorrect to
assume that entrepreneurship is a resource that would only be forthcoming
in a private property system. Even without the remuneration
to entrepreneurship available in a capitalist system, there would in all
likelihood be many people who would learn and would like to exercise
the entrepreneurial skill that society needs.
5.2.4 Risk Propensity
The third category of scarce and valuable attributes that capitalism
rightly (it is said) remunerates with profits is the willingness to take
risks. This factor, again, is not captured in the models presented thus
far. In reality investment is a risky business. Suppose there are two
kinds of people: those willing to take risks and those not willing to
take risks. Among the risk takers, many go bankrupt (and perhaps
become proletarians or people of modest income) and some become
capitalists. Proletarians are those who are not willing to take risks or
those who have taken them and failed. Their surplus labor, accruing
to the capitalists as profits, is the insurance premium they pay to
capitalists to take risks for them. The worker is guaranteed his steady
wage and sleeps well at night, paying the capitalist to gamble for him.
I find this story extremely implausible. I believe that many workers
would like to have the opportunity to become capitalists; they would
love to take those risks. But they cannot, either because of lack of
access to capital markets or because of lack of some aspect of entrepreneurial
ability (which might include having the right connections).
Second, it cannot be seriously maintained that a worker's life involves
less risk than a capitalist's. Workers face the risk of occupational
disease, unemployment, and an impoverished retirement, which
capitalists and managers do not face. Failing as a capitalist does not
usually mean becoming destitute. I do not know of any sociological
studies that verify my belief, but I think that the /I American dream"
encourages most young American white workers to try to escape
from the working class, in one way or another, by taking various
kinds of financial risks. If they fail, it is not for lack of trying but for
lack of something else, most likely access to capital of a sufficient
amount to escape the perils of small business.

5.2.5 Luck
Some argue (for example, Robert Nozick, 1974) that luck is a legitimate
means of acquiring assets and that this factor could justify an
initial distribution of capital that is highly unequal. Here I am not
referring to luck that is the consequence of having taken a gamble:
that would be covered under risk propensity. The kind of luck I am
referring to is that which is not the outcome of choice under uncertainty
on the part of the agent but is completely unanticipated; it is
sometimes called brute luck. Perhaps the most important kind of luck
by which people may acquire differential ownership of capital stock is
inheritance.
Inheritance can be looked at from the point of view of the giver or
the receiver. If one agrees that the giver has property rights in the
wealth that she has legitimately earned and saved by virtue of her
labor, skills, rate of time preference, and propensity toward risk, then
it would seem that she should be entitled to dispose of that wealth as
she pleases, and that would include giving it away to whatever heir
she chooses. But from the point of view of the next generation-the
group of potential receivers-inheritance constitutes perhaps the
grossest of unequal opportunities. Does not everyone in the next
generation have the right to begin with the same opportunities, including
those determined by access to capital? This, after all, is a
particularly easy kind of opportunity to equalize, unlike the differential
opportunities that exist naturally by virtue of the fact that people
grow up in different families.
Rights must be circumscribed in many ways, because a complete
set of rights one might like to specify cannot simultaneously be satisfied.
It seems to me that the right of the generation of givers must be
constrained by the unequal opportunities it creates for the receivers.
From an ethical viewpoint, I do not think it is so difficult to argue
against the right to inheritance. But there is an efficiency issue that
must be faced in advocating stiff inheritance taxes, and it is of the
same nature as the efficiency question discussed under entrepreneurship.
If inheritance of physical assets is forbidden, will that restriction
act as a disincentive for people to save? The answer to this question is
unclear; we do not have enough experience with the enforcement of
stiff inheritance taxes in capitalist countries to know. Alfred Nobel
created the trust that finances the prizes bearing his name instead of
giving his accumulated wealth to his children, for he felt that they
should earn it the hard way, as he did. One might allow an estate to
68 The Morality of Exploitation
escape taxes if the donor gave it for some specific purpose, such as
building a hospital, or buying a piece of land for a park, or financing
an opera company, each of which could bear her name. Means by
which her contribution to society would be publicly recognized could
easily be created. These alternatives to passing wealth down to individuals
might both be socially more useful than the individual alternative
and create as much incentive to save as the present inheritance
laws do. The efficiency argument for individualized inheritance is not
convincing; such a claim would have to be established empirically.
In a recent paper, D. W. Haslett argues for purifying capitalism, a
system that he otherwise likes, by abolishing inheritance. He regards
inheritance as an institution inconsistent with the equality of opportunity
that capitalism champions. Haslett, like Alfred Nobel, believes
that virtuous incentive effects would be generated by abolishing inheritance.
He offers the following analogy. If two runners start a race
with one far behind the other, will the second runner try hard to win?
Indeed, how fast will the leader run? Contrast this with how hard
each of them will run if they begin the race together. The analogy
implies that everyone will work harder if the members of each generation
begin with the same level of wealth, assuming people have the
usual desires to excel materialistically.
It is worth noting the degree to which inheritance is responsible for
differential wealth in the United States. The wealthiest 1 to 2% of
American families own 20 to 30% of the net family wealth in the
United States. The wealthiest 20% own 80% of the wealth, whereas
the poorest 20% own just 0.2% of the wealth. Inequality of wealth is
far more severe than inequality of income: the top 20% of families in
the income distribution earned 57% of the total family income in the
mid-1970s. In a study published in 1978, John Brittain showed that
67% of the large fortunes in the United States are derived from inheritance,
not present earnings. Even while nominal inheritance taxes
were fairly high (before 1981, when the Reagan administration started
reducing them), the actual taxes paid on large estates were incredibly
small. The average tax rate on estates was 0.2%, and on estates of
over $500,000 it was a mere 0.8%. Thus it is said that the inheritance
tax is a voluntary one, or a tax on poor planning. Given these facts
about the origins of current American wealth, it is hard to countenance
the conservative position that the position of people in American
society is due to their hard or skillful work. The family into which
a person is born is much more important in determining her fortune
than are any voluntary choices she makes.
The Morality of Exploitation 69
On grounds of equal opportunity, I think there is a strong argument
against luck as a legitimate means for acquiring material assets.
One might better argue that those assets which materialize because of
luck belong to everyone, not to the person on whom they just happen
to fall. Why should the point in time at which opportunities are
declared to be equal be before Lady Luck has thrown the dice, and
not after? After all, by definition, no one has done anything to earn
the fruits of luck, and the motivation for equality of opportunity is
that each is entitled to what he earns from a starting point of equality.
(This statement applies to luck that is not the outcome of a calculated
gamble, which, as I said, is a case excluded here but included under
considerations of the rights to earn differentially from differential risk
propensities. )
Whether the argument of the preceding paragraph also makes a
case against allowing individuals to reap the fruits of genetic luck is a
more difficult question. Do I have the moral right to the income
stream that my inborn talent enables me to earn?
5.3 Justification of Unequal Distribution
A normative justification for measuring exploitation lies in the meaning
of the colloquial definition of exploitation: "to take unfair advantage
of." Because exploitation is the consequence of inequality in the
initial distribution of physical assets, it would seem that its existence
indicates unfairness only if the initial unequal distribution of assets is
unfair. Marxists argue that all capitalist societies established the takeoff
point of unequal capital ownership by processes akin to robbery,
slavery, and plunder. If this argument is accepted, the case for unfairness
is then clearly made, the unfair nature of the exploitative allocation
being inherited, as it were, from the initial unjust distribution.
But ideologues of capitalism have argued that the initial distribution
of unequal ownership could have arisen (even if actually it did not) in
morally respectable ways: as a result of differences in the rates of time
preference, or in risk propensities, or in entrepreneurial abilities and
skills, or as a result of unanticipated luck. Such a clean beginning
would establish the cogency of capitalism as a system against which
there is, so they say, no principled ethical argument-although there
may be specific arguments against specific historical instances of capitalism.
Capitalist ideologues argue from two fronts: that it is necessary
to recognize and reward these differential attributes of people
70 The Morality of Exploitation
differentially in order for the good attributes to emerge and be available
for society, and that the holders of these attributes deserve the
fruits that thereby accrue to them in a private ownership system.
These arguments are not consistent either with economic theory or
with the history of developed capitalism, a history replete with the
establishment of fortunes by wars, or through the exercise of monopoly
power, or as the consequence of market imperfections.
At the most general level, neoclassical economists maintain that (at
least in a certain class of economies) all income generated can be
viewed as the return to some factor. But it is unclear whether return
means an income which that factor must receive to continue to offer
its services, or an income that should, on ethical grounds, go to that
factor. There is, furthermore, the distinction, not usually made in
neoclassical analysis, between the factor and its owner. One cannot in
general divide the pie produced by capital goods and labor up into
two parts, one of which was produced by labor and one by capital.
Nor, even if one could, is it clear that the part produced by the capital
should go to the capitalist and the part produced by labor should go
to the laborer. The Marxist analysis avoids the notion of returns and
argues instead that the cooperation of labor and physical capital and
land produces an income that is larger than the income needed to
reproduce the factors used up, and is even larger than the income
needed to get people to offer those factors for use. There is a genuine
surplus, and society must adopt some rules for distributing it. Under
capitalism, the distribution of the surplus is decided on the basis of
property rights in the ownership of the initial factors. Workers and
capitalists may bargain over the property rights in the surplus to
which their factor contribution entitles them. The state takes some of
the surplus through taxation; and the tax laws may also be the consequence
of interclass bargaining, the state acting as an agent representing
one of the classes, or perhaps as an independent agent with its
own interests. But the deep justification of capitalism must be based
on a justification, either on pragmatic (efficiency) grounds or on ethical
grounds, of the initial distribution of ownership in the means of
production, a distribution that sets the initial conditions for interclass
bargaining over the surplus.
There is one particularly opportunistic argument that defenders of
unequal ownership make: "What's good for General Motors is good
for the country." In other words, capitalists must have the prospect of
a sufficiently high profit rate in order to invest (rather than to conThe
Morality of Exploitation 71
sume, presumably, or to take their capital elsewhere). So for workers
to have jobs it is necessary that profits exist and be high. Neither
liberals nor conservatives have a principled disagreement with this
statement; they disagree, instead, over the rate at which capital can
be taxed before it "goes on strike." Conservatives say, Not very
much, and liberals say, Quite a lot. Both of these non-Marxist political
viewpoints accept the necessity of returns to capitalists in principle.
But the Marxist position need not argue that taxes on profits or wages
can be increased substantially under capitalism; it need not favor
policies that would lower the rate of profit and cloud an otherwise
good investment climate. It can accept the necessity of high profits for
the viability of capitalism and use that to argue against the Suitability
of an economic system based on private ownership of the means of
production. If those who control the capital stock have to be bribed in
order to make it available to society, is that an argument for bribing
them or an argument against the system that makes such bribes
necessary?
