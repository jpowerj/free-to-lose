<p>This chapter presents a simple, algebraic model that formalizes some of the concepts presented in the models of Chapter 2. I will define embodied labor value, exploitation, and the profit rate and then investigate the relationship between exploitation and profits.</p>
<section id="embodied-labor-and-exploitation" class="level2" data-number="4.1">
<h2 data-number="4.1" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="embodied-labor-and-exploitation"><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Embodied Labor and Exploitation</h2>
<p>Imagine a corn economy with just one technology, that called the Factory in Chapter 2. One unit of corn, gross, can be produced using a units of corn as input and L days of labor. Thus, the technology can be summarized</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\{a,L\} \rightarrow 1,
\]</span></p>
<p>or, in terms of net corn production,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\{a,L\} \rightarrow 1 - a.
\]</span></p>
<p>Clearly, for this technology to be productive, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> must be less than 1. Otherwise, stocks would dwindle to zero.</p>
<p>The <em>labor embodied in a unit of corn</em> is defined as the amount of labor that is necessary to produce 1 unit of corn, including the labor needed to reproduce the corn input used in the process. To derive this quantity, let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the amount of corn that would have to be produced in order to end up with 1 unit of corn after replacing the corn input used in the production of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Because the technology is assumed to exhibit constant returns to scale, the production of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> units of corn requires an input of <span class="math inline">\(ax\)</span>; to end up with 1 unit of corn, net, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> must satisfy</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-1"><span class="math display">\[
x=ax+1.
\tag{4.1}\]</span></span></p>
<p><a href="#eq-4-1" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> can be read as “gross output = input used + net output.” Solving <a href="#eq-4-1" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.1</span></a> for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
x = \frac{1}{1 - a}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The amount of labor needed to produce this amount of corn is, therefore,</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-2"><span class="math display">\[
\frac{L}{1 - a} \equiv \lambda.
\tag{4.2}\]</span></span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the labor embodied in a unit of corn.</p>
<p>There is a useful interpretation of <a href="#eq-4-2" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.2</span></a>. Because <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; 1\)</span>, we can expand the expression <span class="math inline">\(L/(1 - a)\)</span> as a geometric series</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-3"><span class="math display">\[
\lambda = L + La + La^2 + La^3 + \cdots
\tag{4.3}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In <a href="#eq-4-3" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.3</span></a>, the first term <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> is the direct, live labor expended today to produce 1 unit of corn, gross. But we must replace the seed corn, used in amount <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The labor that had to be expended last week to produce a unit of seed corn for use this week was <span class="math inline">\(La\)</span>, the second term. But, how much seed input was needed two weeks ago, to plant then, so as to have a units of corn available last week? Precisely <span class="math inline">\(a^2\)</span> units of corn, and that required expending, two weeks ago, <span class="math inline">\(La^2\)</span> units of direct labor. In this way, the expression <a href="#eq-4-3" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.3</span></a> decomposes the labor embodied in a unit of corn into the direct labor expended at various times in the past to produce the inputs needed to produce the inputs needed to produce the inputs needed, and so on forever back into the past, to produce the corn today.</p>
<p>There is another useful derivation of the labor embodied in a unit of corn. The embodied labor value of a good is the sum of live labor expended during the current production period to produce the good, plus the labor already embodied in the inputs used in production. Let <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> stand for the embodied labor value in a unit of corn. The labor expended today in producing corn is <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span>, and the labor embodied in the a units of corn used as an input in corn’s production is, by definition, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda a\)</span>, because <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the labor content of 1 unit of corn. Thus, by the second sentence of this paragraph,</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-4"><span class="math display">\[
\lambda = L + \lambda a
\tag{4.4}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Solving <a href="#eq-4-4" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.4</span></a> for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> yields, again, <a href="#eq-4-2" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a>.</p>
<p>The expression <a href="#eq-4-2" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.2</span></a> looks very much like the multiplier in macroeconomics, and this is no accident. Recall that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{align*}
Y &amp;= C + I \; \text{ (gross output = consumption + investment)} \\
C &amp;= aY + d \; \text{ (consumption function)}.
\end{align*}
\]</span></p>
<p>Combining these two equations yields</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
Y = \frac{d + I}{1 - a}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The interpretation is the same as that given for expression <a href="#eq-4-2" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.2</span></a>. An increase in investment from <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(I + \Delta I\)</span> increases national income, not by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta I\)</span>, but by <span class="math inline">\(\Delta I / (1 - a)\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is the propensity to consume. An increase in investment of <span class="math inline">\(\Delta I\)</span> leads to an increased consumption of <span class="math inline">\(a \Delta I\)</span>; in turn, those consumption expenditures generate additional incomes of <span class="math inline">\(a\Delta I\)</span>, and people receiving that income increase their consumption by <span class="math inline">\(a^2 \Delta I\)</span>, and so on into the future. Thus, the decomposition</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\frac{\Delta I}{1 - a} = \Delta I + a\Delta I + a^2 \Delta I + \cdots
\]</span></p>
<p>has the same sort of interpretation, going into the future, as the decomposition of <a href="#eq-4-3" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.3</span></a> does going into the past.</p>
<p><em>Socially necessary labor time</em> is defined as the amount of labor embodied in the bundle that the worker consumes, a bundle that he purchases with his wage. Suppose that the daily subsistence amount of corn that a worker consumes in this economy is <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> units of corn. If the wage is a subsistence wage, then his entire wage is spent on purchasing this amount of corn. Thus, socially necessary labor time is defined as</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-5"><span class="math display">\[
\text{SNLT} \equiv \lambda b = \frac{bL}{1 - a}.
\tag{4.5}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Notice that this definition is slightly different from that in Chapter 2, where the total capital stock available was considered and socially necessary labor time was an appropriate average of labor time expended in the Factory and Farm sectors. In this model, which has no Farm sector, I do not have that option. Although the definitions are different, the end result will be about the same, and one should not worry about this detail, except to acknowledge its existence.</p>
<p>Suppose labor time is denominated in days of labor. There is some fixed length of the working day, by hypothesis; and, by definition, the worker works for 1 day in order to receive his wage, which is <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. The wage can be paid in either corn or money. The worker is said to be exploited if the amount of corn he can purchase with his daily wage embodies less than 1 day, the amount of time the worker toiled to earn the wage. If the daily wage just suffices to purchase corn in amount <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, then the worker is exploited if</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\lambda b &lt; 1.
\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>rate of exploitation</em> is defined as</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-6"><span class="math display">\[
e = \frac{1 - \lambda b}{\lambda b}.
\tag{4.6}\]</span></span></p>
<p>In other words, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the ratio of surplus labor time expended by the worker to socially necessary labor time. The <em>surplus labor time</em> is that portion of the daily labor that the worker expends above that embodied in the corn he is paid. It becomes embodied in corn that ends up as profits for the capitalist, as I will show in the next section.</p>
</section>
<section id="prices-and-the-profit-rate" class="level2" data-number="4.2">
<h2 data-number="4.2" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="prices-and-the-profit-rate"><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Prices and the Profit Rate</h2>
<p>Suppose a unit of corn sells for a price of <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, denominated in some currency. Then the fact that the wage in this model is a subsistence one is summarized by</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-7"><span class="math display">\[
pb = w.
\tag{4.7}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The amount the worker must pay to buy his corn bundle is just his wage.</p>
<p>For each unit of corn the capitalist produces, she must pay <span class="math inline">\(pa + wL\)</span> for her inputs of corn and labor. I assume she pays the wage at the beginning of the production period (which may not be realistic), so wage costs are considered to be part of her investment costs. (But nothing of significance changes if the capitalist pays the workers at the end of the production period.) Then the profits per unit of corn that a capitalist makes, because I assume she is able to sell her corn at the going price, are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p - (pa + wL) = \text{ unit profits}.
\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>profit rate</em>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, is defined as the rate at which her investment grows; it is the ratio of profits to investment. Thus,</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-8"><span class="math display">\[
\pi = \frac{p - (pa + wL)}{pa + wL}.
\tag{4.8}\]</span></span></p>
<p>Rewriting <a href="#eq-4-8" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.8</span></a> in a more convenient form yields</p>
<p><span id="eq-4-9"><span class="math display">\[
p = (1 + \pi)(pa + wL).
\tag{4.9}\]</span></span></p>
<p>The capitalist in this model wishes to expand her stock of capital. She is not the same sort of subsistence agent discussed in Chapter 2. Her preferences, for whatever reason, are for accumulation and dictate that she expand her capital stock as rapidly as possible. I will not inquire into what social norms or other constraints or forces give rise to these preferences in capitalists. Suffice it to say that competition among capitalists forces each to expand as rapidly as possible in order to have the funds to innovate and not be driven out of the market altogether. So in this model I will simply assume that capitalists strive to accumulate. The measure of the rate of the capitalist’s accumulation is <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>, the profit rate. It is the rate at which investment capital expands from one period to the next.</p>
<p>In summary, the data of the model are <span class="math inline">\(\{a,L,b\}\)</span>. These are given, exogenous magnitudes. The endogenous variables, determined by the data, are <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. Notice that I have left out <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>. There is one degree of freedom in the model, because there are more unknowns than equations. <a href="#eq-4-2" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.2</span></a> defines <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> from the data and <a href="#eq-4-6" class="quarto-xref">Equation&nbsp;<span>4.6</span></a> defines <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>. I am left with Equations <a href="#eq-4-7" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.7</span></a> and <a href="#eq-4-9" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.9</span></a> to determine <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>. This cannot be done uniquely, because only relative prices matter. I therefore have the liberty to set either <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> at some arbitrary level, and I have chosen to set <span class="math inline">\(w = 1\)</span>. Hence, the price <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> is the price of corn relative to the wage, or the wage-price of corn.</p>

<p>The expression <span class="math inline">\(a + bL\)</span> is called the <em>augmented input coefficient</em>. The first term, <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, is the amount of corn that must be planted in the ground to yield 1 unit of corn. The second term, <span class="math inline">\(bL\)</span>, is the amount of corn that must be fed into the worker to yield 1 unit of corn. Hence, from a technological point of view, <span class="math inline">\(a + bL\)</span> is the amount of corn that must be used as input, in one way or another, in the production of 1 unit of corn. If there are to be any profits, this augmented input coefficient had better be less than the amount of corn produced,</p>

<p>And from <a href="#eq-4-10" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.10</span></a>, this is just the condition necessary to generate a positive value for the rate of profit, <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>.</p>
<p>Thus, the condition summarized by inequality <a href="#eq-4-11" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.11</span></a> is required for generating a positive rate of profit. What is the condition for generating a positive rate of exploitation?

<p>But by the derivation of the formula <a href="#eq-4-5" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.5</span></a> for socially necessary labor time, <a href="#eq-4-12" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.12</span></a> is equivalent to</p>

<p>which is just condition <a href="#eq-4-11" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.11</span></a>, the necessary and sufficient condition for a positive rate of profit. Thus, condition <a href="#eq-4-11" class="quarto-xref"><span>4.11</span></a> is necessary and sufficient both for the rate of profit to be positive and for the rate of exploitation to be positive. This is summarized by the following theorem.</p>

</div>
<p>In other words, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a positive profit rate is that labor be exploited. Some writers have called this the fundamental Marxian theorem (Morishima, 1973). (I do not think it is really so fundamental, for reasons I will mention later.) The theorem verifies the intuition, mentioned earlier, that surplus labor becomes embodied as profits. It is only by virtue of the fact that workers are paid a wage enabling them to buy only an amount of corn embodying less labor than they expended in production that some corn is left over for capitalists. Whether the capitalists consume this surplus, or sell it to buyers other than workers, or invest it, is not my present concern.</p>
<p><a href="#thm-4-1" class="quarto-xref">Theorem&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a> shows that profits are positive if and only if workers are exploited. But what makes it possible for capitalists to exploit workers? Why should the corn wage, <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, not rise until the profit rate falls to zero? The answer to this question is provided in Chapter 2. Capitalists own scarce capital-in this case, seed corn-which is needed for production. Recall that the technology <span class="math inline">\(\{a,L\}\)</span> in this model is like the Factory technology of Chapter 2. Because of the scarcity of seed corn (which is owned by the capitalists) relative to the labor available for hire, workers compete for access to the technology, a situation keeping their wage low enough to maintain a positive rate of profit. In other words, the wage is bid down to just the amount required by the worker as a consequence of competition among the workers for employment on the scarce capital stock. Nothing in the story requires that the corn wage of workers be a subsistence wage in any biological sense. As long as labor is sufficiently abundant relative to the capital that is available to employ it, the wage rate will settle at some level that permits a positive rate of profit. At any such wage rate, exploitation occurs.</p>

<p>One weakness of the model presented thus far is that it does not provide for a division of labor among workers. Everybody produces only corn and consumes only corn. The social division of labor can be exhibited only in a model in which many goods are produced. To analyze such a model requires some linear algebra. But, in the final analysis, the result is just the same as <a href="#thm-4-1" class="quarto-xref">Theorem&nbsp;<span>4.1</span></a>: profits exist if and only if there is exploitation.</p>

<p>The derivation of prices in the multidimensional model requires an additional argument: I must invoke the fact that capitalists compete. There are now n possible sectors to invest in, but a capitalist will only invest in lines of production that achieve the maximal profit rate, for no other line will expand his capital so rapidly. Let p be the n-dimensional row vector of prices of goods. (Recall that in Section 4.1 the daily wage was set at 1 and that Aj is the jth column of A.) Then the cost of inputs and labor to produce 1 unit of good j is pAj + Lj, Exploitation and Profits 45 and hence the profit rate, at prices p, of producing good j is po - (pA + Lo) 1To == J _ I I (4.20) J pAj + Lj . I have argued that only those processes that achieve the maximal profit rate will be operated. Suppose that in this economy all the sectors must operate (perhaps in order to produce the subsistence requirements and the inputs required for that purpose). Then the economy cannot be considered to be in a long-run equilibrium unless prices are such that all sectors generate the maximal profit rate and all goods are produced. Hence, at such an equilibrium, the profit rates are equalized across all sectors; I will call that uniform profit rate 1T. The price equation can be deduced from (4.20): p = (1 + 1T)(pA + L), (4.21) which is a vector equation stating that the vector p is proportional in its components to the vector (pA + L), with a constant of proportionality (1 + 1T). As before, the subsistence wage equation can be written as pb = 1, (4.22) which states that workers must expend their entire daily wage to purchase the daily subsistence requirement b. Substituting from (4.22) into (4.21) and factoring p out of the right-hand side yields p = (1 + 1T)p(A + bL), (4.23) where A + bL is the augmented input coefficient matrix. Note that bL is the product of a column vector with a row vector, each of length n; so it is an n X n matrix. Indeed the ij th component of A + bL, which is ajj + bjLj, is just the total amount of good i that enters into production of good j when one considers not only the factor input that occurs directly (ajj), but also the input of good i that enters indirectly into good j through the worker’s consumption. This last amount is bjLj and is called the labor-feeding input coefficient. A theorem of linear algebra known as the Frobenius-Perron theorem asserts that if the matrix (A + bL) is productive, in the sense defined earlier, then a unique nonnegative price vector p and an associated profit rate 1T that solve Equation (4.23) exist. Thus, prices capable of reproducing this economy exist, so long as the technological and subsistence data {A,L,b} render the augmented technology (A + bL) capable of producing a surplus.</p>

Hence it should be possible to investigate whether there is a relationship between the condition for a positive rate of exploitation, as given by (4.24), and the existence of a positive rate of profit.

<p>In Chapter 3 I presented the notion that capitalism and feudalism share a common trait, namely, the extraction of a surplus by a small class of property owners from a large class of direct producers. This view is verified by Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 of the last two sections. According to these theorems, profits exist because workers only spend part of the working day working for themselves; the rest of the day they work to produce the profits of the capitalist. Under feudalism this separation of work time between necessary and surplus time was observable by the producer, but such is not the case under capitalism, because of the social division of labor and the production of commodities. A worker does not actually produce the goods b that he consumes. Suppose that he produces auto fenders all day long. Further suppose that the auto worker works 40 hours a week producing fenders, but the wages he is paid enable him to buy consumption goods embodying only 20 hours of labor (expended mostly by other workers). Because of the social division of labor, he has no clear conception of the amount of labor that is necessary to produce the goods he consumes. For the auto worker, the division of his labor time is not apparent. For the serf under feudalism, however, the work week, or work year, was clearly divided into labor time expended in the production of his subsistence commodities and labor time expended directly for the lord. Thus, the social division of labor-the arrangement by which no worker in modem capitalism produces all the goods that make up his consumption bundle-obscures the relation of exploitation between capitalist and worker. A commodity is defined as a good produced for exchange, not for the producer’s own use. Capitalist production, unlike most production under feudalism, is commodity production. And commodity production is clearly related to the existence of the social division of labor. It could therefore be said that the system of commodity production is responsible for obscuring the nature of exploitation in a capitalist economy.</p>

<h2 data-number="4.6" class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-labor-theory-of-value"><span class="header-section-number">4.6</span> The Labor Theory of Value</h2>
<p>Associated with the classical economists Smith and Ricardo, and also with Marx, is the claim that prices in a market economy are a reflection of the embodied labor values of commodities. In its starkest form this assertion is interpreted to mean that prices are proportional to labor values; that is, that the vector p is proportional to the vector A. In fact, Marx did not assert this “labor theory of value.” Rather he used it as an approximation to simplify his arguments about exploitation, because he (rightly) believed that the deviations of prices from embodied labor values were not relevant to his theory of exploitation. The price vector p that solves Equation (4.23) is not proportional to the vector A that solves Equation (4.18), except in certain unusual circumstances (either when the profit rate is zero, or when the technology exhibits a singular property known as equal “organic compositions of capital”). Nevertheless, as I have shown in this chapter, the relationship between exploitation and profits does not depend on the proportionality of labor values to prices, and so nothing of substance is lost by acknowledging that the labor theory of value is false. Then why did classical economists put some stock in the claim that exchange values, or prices, would be proportional to labor values? 48 Exploitation and Profits Imagine a society that produces deer and beaver, as in Adam Smith’s example. In this society everyone needs or wants to consume the same consumption bundle of venison and beaver pelts-say, 1 unit of venison and 1 beaver pelt. Suppose that it takes 6 days to hunt a deer and produce 1 unit of venison ready for trade or consumption and 3 days to produce 1 beaver pelt. Suppose that all labor is equally skilled at either occupation and can move freely between the venison and beaver pelt industries. But suppose further that set-up costs are such that there is a social division of labor, so people must trade with one another to end up with their desired consumption bundle. Suppose that people have subsistence preferences and want to minimize their labor expended in hunting. What will the equilibrium price ratio be between venison and beaver pelts?</p>
<p>It will be 2. At that price ratio, each person, regardless of occupation, will spend 9 days hunting, and each will end up with his desired consumption bundle. If the price ratio were higher than 2 everyone would want to move into the venison industry, in an attempt to reduce their hunting times. More realistically, some beaver trappers would start to move into the venison industry, thereby producing an oversupply of venison and driving down its price. If the price ratio were less than 2, producers would move into the beaver pelt industry. Thus, the only price ratio that can support the production of both venison and beaver pelts is 2. Note that 2 is also the ratio of the embodied labor of venison to the embodied labor of beaver pelts, because those labor times are 6 days and 3 days, respectively. Thus, equilibrium prices are proportional to embodied labor values.</p>
<p>In the deer-beaver model, the labor theory of value is true. It fails to be true, however, once capital stock is introduced into the economy- so long as the capital stock is scarce relative to the hunters who would use it. Suppose that hunting a beaver requires traps and that hunting a deer requires bows and arrows and that these implements take a fairly long time to make. A hunter who does not already own traps or bows cannot devote time to making them, because it takes so long to do so that he would not have time to earn his consumption bundle and would starve. Now, suppose that there is a capital stock of bows and traps owned by a class of agents who had them made in the past, from their accumulated surpluses. These capitalists today will hire trappers to use the traps and bows to hunt beaver and deer and will pay them wages in return. If there is a scarcity of traps and bows relative to the trappers who would use them, then the wage of trappers will be bid down to that amount needed to purchase only Exploitation and Profits 49 their “subsistence” bundle of 1 beaver pelt and 1 unit of venison. The embodied labor of both beaver pelts and venison must now include an element that takes into account the depreciation of the traps and bows incurred when they are used to hunt the deer and beaver. Moreover, the prices of venison and beaver pelts will include an element of profit that the owners of the implements are able to charge by virtue of the scarcity of their capital stock. When the prices of beaver pelts, venison, and traps and bows equilibrate to a level at which trappers can purchase their consumption bundle with the wage and at which profit rates in the various lines of production are equalized so that all goods will be produced, it will no longer be true that equilibrium prices of beaver pelts and venison are proportional to the embodied labor values of beaver pelts and venison.</p>
<p>The deer-beaver model without capital shows why classical economists believed there was some tendency for market prices to be proportional to embodied labor values of commodities. This relation does exist so long as all goods are produced without scarce capital and so long as there are no naturally scarce and nonproduced inputs (like land) that will command a rent, which will be a component of the price.</p>
<p>Marxists also adhere to a labor theory of value because of their belief that the real source of all value is labor. Marx argued that the one property that all commodities had in common was their production by “abstract labor.” It is hard to see why this should be regarded as the one property that all produced commodities have in common. They also share the property of being desired by people; and that property gives rise to a welfare-based theory of value (which is reflected in the statement occurring in neoclassical economic theory that prices are proportional to marginal utilities). In fact, the labor theory of value is a supply-side theory, in which prices are thought to be determined entirely by their labor costs; in contrast, emphasizing the importance of the degree to which a commodity fulfills desires or needs or welfare in determining its price is the demand side. The correct theory of market price must take both supply and demand into account. There are some special cases in which demand will not affect price, which is technologically determined, but recourse to those cases should not be sought in an attempt to defend the labor theory of value.</p>
<p>I will present one more example in order to emphasize the point that the existence of exploitation, in the Marxist sense, has nothing to do with the proportionality of labor values to prices. Imagine that Andrea planted grape vines on scarce land several years ago and that the grapes are now ready to harvest. Bob would like to consume the wine that can be made from the grapes. Andrea expended very little labor in planting the vines-as little as you please. (Imagine that she only had to press a button some years ago to start the grape-growing process.) Furthermore, assume that no more labor is needed to make the grapes into wine today. Bob produces bread today, which requires a good deal of current labor. He wants to trade some of his bread for Andrea’s wine, and Andrea does not want to drink her wine on an empty stomach, so she also wants to trade. After the trade has taken place, Bob will be consuming a bundle of bread and wine, which together embody less labor than he expended-for, by hypothesis, the wine embodies almost no labor. Andrea, in contrast, worked hardly at all and consumes wine and bread that embodies a good deal of Bob’s labor. The prices at which bread and wine exchange do not reflect the amounts of labor embodied in the two commodities. Andrea’s wine may command quite a high price relative to Bob’s bread, because no other source of wine is available for Bob, but Andrea could produce her own daily bread by expending the appropriate labor. One might wish to argue that Andrea is exploiting Bob, because some of his labor has been transferred to her (embodied in the bread), whereas he gets virtually none of her labor in return.</p>
<p>In this case, the time elapsed between the planting of the grapes and the present is like capital: although wine can be produced, it cannot be produced quickly, and this is reflected in the price of wine. Or, perhaps more to the point, Andrea but not Bob owns scarce land, a circumstance that explains why Bob did not plant vines some time ago. Note that this example is especially simple, because neither Andrea nor Bob hires the other. Nevertheless, Andrea exploits Bob, in the technical sense, because he expended more labor than is embodied in the bundle of bread and wine he ends up possessing and consuming, and she expended less labor than that embodied in what she consumes. The transfer of labor from Bob to Andrea occurs in an indirect fashion-through the trade of the commodities they produce- because the prices of those commodities are not proportional to the labor embodied in them. One might view the Andrea-Bob economy as a precapitalist one, because the relationship of wage labor has not yet been established. Nevertheless, the divergence of commodity prices from labor values has emerged, because there is an element of capital involved in the production of some goods. As long as there is differential ownership of the capital stock used in producing goods for consumption today, commodity prices will not generally be proportional to labor values, and some producers will work more hours than the hours embodied in the goods they consume while others work fewer.</p>
<p>Even though Marx understood that equilibrium prices were not generally proportional to embodied labor values in a market economy, he made many calculations in an attempt to elucidate how labor values could be “transformed” mathematically into equilibrium prices. One might view this algebraic transformation problem as an attempt to mirror the transformation of economies from simple deerbeaver economies in which prices are proportional to labor values to capitalist economies in which they are not. However, this line of inquiry is not fruitful. The insights from Marxist analysis that remain useful do not require reference to the labor theory of value, or to a special Marxist theory of price determination. Prices are determined by market-clearing (equilibrium) requirements, by the equating of supply and demand.</p>
<p>I have referred to a stark form of the labor theory of value, which maintains that prices are proportional to embodied labor values. There is a looser claim advocated by some, namely, that the labor theory of value means that embodied labor values determine equilibrium prices, though not proportionally. Although it is hard to evaluate such a claim, because “determination” is not as clear a relationship as “proportionality” is, there is no interesting sense in which this claim is true. Indeed, there is a sense in which the direction of determination is the other way, that prices determine labor values. Further references on this matter are given in the Bibliographical Notes for this chapter.</p>
<p>Although I have verified the claim that exploitation of workers is necessary and sufficient for positive profits, no further headway has been made toward understanding what might be morally wrong with exploitation. Until one can pass judgment on the morality of differential ownership of the capital stock, it is difficult to form an opinion about the exploitation that is its consequence. This is why I remarked earlier that the theorems of this chapter are not so fundamental. To make headway toward understanding the essential ethical question requires some analysis of the conditions that lead to the exploitation of workers, and this is the topic of the next chapter.</p>
