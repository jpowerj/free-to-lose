<p>Exploitation has a technical definition that must be distinguished from its colloquial one. When Marxists say that workers are exploited by capitalists, they mean-colloquially-that an economic relation of exploitation exists between workers and capitalists (that workers are used by capitalists) and that capitalists take unfair advantage of workers (that workers are used by capitalists in an ethically indefensible way). In this chapter I will define exploitation in a technical sense, using a simple model of an economy that produces only one good. In Chapter 5, I will discuss when technical exploitation should be considered as unfair treatment of workers by capitalists. 2.1 An Egalitarian Distribution of Capital Imagine a society consisting of 1,000 members. There is one produced good, corn, which all like to consume. Corn is produced from inputs of labor and seed corn. All members of this society are equally skilled and productive, and all have knowledge of the technologies that exist for producing corn. Each person is assumed to have subsistence preferences: each needs to consume 1 unit of corn per week (to survive, let us say); after having done so he prefers to take leisure rather than to work more and consume more corn. There is one additional condition: each agent desires to reproduce the stock of seed corn, if any, with which he began. He does not want to begin the next week with a smaller corn stock, which is the only kind of capital in this model. Thus, a person’s utility, or welfare level, is a function of corn consumed and labor expended-or corn consumed and leisure conThe Origin of Exploitation 15 sumed. The particular preferences I have posited are easy to analyze, “because the trade-offs between corn and leisure are very simple: to get 1 unit of corn, a person is willing to do anything, and after that he is willing to do nothing. Suppose there is a total initial capital stock of 500 units of corn (K = SOO). Further, assume that in this society there are two ways of producing corn, or two techniques of production, which are called the Farm and the Factory: Farm 3 days labor 1 ’t f + 0 units of seed corn ~ urn a corn Factory 1 day labor 2 units of corn, gross, + 1 unit of seed corn ~ or 1 unit of corn, net The production period for both the Farm and the Factory techniques is 1 week (7 days); that is, seed corn is tied up in the ground that long before it produces a harvest, even though it may take only 1 day to plant, as in the Factory technology. Thus far, no distribution of the means of production, or of the capital stock, which in this model is just seed corn, has been assumed. Now assume that there is an egalitarian distribution of capital stock. Each agent owns V2 unit of corn-the aggregate capital stock is divided equally among all. Given the technologies described, the preferences of the agents, and the distribution of assets, what is the equilibrium in this economy? The equilibrium solution is that each agent works a total of 2 days: V2 day in the Factory and 1 V2 days on the Farm. Assume that a person can switch castles sly and instantaneously between one technology and the other. In the V2 day a woman works in the Factory technology, she plants her V2 unit of seed corn, which at the end of the week will yield for her 1 unit of corn, gross. Her capital stock is tied up in the ground for that week. The 1 unit of corn, gross, she gets in this process is sufficient to replace her original seed corn stock and leave her V2 unit of corn to consume. She must somewhere produce another V2 unit of corn for consumption; and to do so she moves to the Farm, where in IV2 days she can produce Vz unit of corn, with no capital stock. One might ask what type of technology can produce corn using labor alone. Perhaps the Farm technology involves going to the forest and hunting around for wild corn, which grows there: this labor16 The Origin of Exploitation intensive process yields corn but requires much more labor than is needed to produce an equivalent amount of corn using the Factory process. But the specific technologies of production are irrelevant. The important assumption is that there are two ways of surviving in the economy. One way is to engage in a production process that uses capital, that is, some scarce nonlabor input, which in this model is seed corn. The alternative way is one everyone can engage in whether or not he has access to capital-in this model, the Farm technology . The solution I have outlined is autarkic-there is no trade. Each person works only for herself; she neither sells nor hires labor, nor does anyone sell corn to anyone else. The solution is dearly egalitarian. Each person works 2 days and consumes 1 unit of corn. No one can do any better, and the corn stock is reproduced for the beginning of the next week. A careful definition of the term equilibrium is not necessary; simply notice that this is the natural solution to the problem that people face in this economy-of producing the corn they require subject to the constraints determined by their capital stock and the technology. Given the subsistence preferences that have been posited, no one will work any longer, for after consuming 1 unit of corn, these people prefer only to take leisure. From this solution I can define the socially necessary labor time (SNLT) for this society to reproduce itself. Given the technologies, the capital stock, and the consumption requirement, the socially necessary labor time required to produce 1,000 units of corn is 2,000 days; or, from the vantage point of an individual, the labor socially necessary to produce 1 unit of corn is 2 days. Each producer works, in this equilibrium, precisely socially necessary labor time. More generally, the labor time socially necessary to produce a certain amount of corn is the amount of labor that is needed to produce that corn and to reproduce the seed corn used up in the process. Society will use all its capital stock first in the Factory process, which in 1 week will produce 500 units of corn, net, with 500 days of labor; in the meantime the remaining 500 units of corn will be produced by working a total of 1,500 days on the Farm. Suppose that instead of requiring 1 unit of corn per week for consumption, each person requires 2 units of corn per week. Then the total weekly requirement for this society would be 2,000 units of corn. It would still be true that 500 units of corn, net, can be produced using the Factory in 500 days. To produce the additional 1,500 units of corn The Origin of Exploitation 17 required would now necessitate expending 4,500 days of labor on the Farm; and the socially necessary labor time for producing 2,000 units of com would be 5,000 days. Or, from the point of view of the individual; 1 unit of com would require 21/2 days of labor. Thus, the amount of time socially necessary to produce a unit of com depends on the total com production required and on the fraction of that production that must be carried out using the inferior (Farm) technology. If, in a third model society, people only required 1/2 unit of com per week for consumption, then the total com requirement of this society would be 500 units of com per week, all of which could be produced using the Factory technology alone. No one would use the Farm, and the labor time socially necessary to produce 1 unit of com would fall to just 1 day. Return, now, to the initial subsistence preferences, in which each person needs or wants to consume 1 unit of corn per week, in which case the amount of labor time socially necessary to produce society’s requirement is 2 days per unit of com per individual (or 2,000 days in total). I can also say that 2 days is the labor embodied in 1 unit of com. In other words, the labor embodied in a unit of com is the amount of labor required to produce that commodity and to reproduce the inputs used in producing it, given the technologies and capital stock available. Socially necessary labor time is the labor embodied in the com consumption bundle required by the population. There is, however, an ambiguity in this definition that I wish to point out. If I ask, Given the technologies, how much labor is required to produce 1 unit of com, net? the answer is 1 day. (Just use 1 unit of seed com in the Factory.) This, however, cannot be done on an economy-wide scale-that is, this society cannot produce 1,000 units of com in 1,000 days. When I speak of the labor embodied in a unit of com, that should be understood to mean the average amount of social labor time required to produce that unit, given the total amount of com produced. Thus, the labor embodied in 1 unit of com is 2 days in this economy, because at equilibrium 1,000 units of com, net, are produced with 2,000 days of labor. The particular equilibrium solution I have discussed above is autarkic, but there are other ways of arranging an equilibrium in this economy that do involve trading among members-in particular, when some persons hire the labor of others. Suppose there are two groups of agents, called H (for hirers of labor) and S (for sellers of 18 The Origin of Exploitation labor). Any 750 agents may constitute the H group and the remaining 250 will constitute the 5 group. Those in the 5 group are going to sell their labor for a wage to those in the H group. Each person in the 5 group first works up her own capital stock using the Factory technology. That requires 1/2 day of labor and generates for her 1/2 unit of corn, net, by the end of the week. 5he needs to earn another V2 unit of corn to consume. Instead of going to the Farm to produce that corn, she offers to sell her labor to someone, or to several members, of the H group. What real wage will prevail in this economy to make this offer of labor attractive to both hirers and sellers on the labor market? The answer is that members of H will offer to hire members of 5 to work on their (H’s) capital stock at a wage rate of 3 days labor for 1 unit of corn, or a real wage of V3 unit of corn per day’s labor. Why? First, observe that at this wage rate a member of 5 can work up the capital stock of 3 members of H, expending a total of 11/2 days of labor, a~d she will earn as a total wage precisely V2 unit of corn. Combining the labor traded with that she has already done for herself, she will have worked a total of 2 days-partly for herself and mainly for others-earned exactly 1 unit of corn, and reproduced her original seed stock, as required. 50 a member of 5 is willing to accept this wage: she is indifferent between this proposal and working autarkically in the Factory and then on the Farm, as in the first equilibrium solution described. Now from the viewpoint of a member of H, he will have his V2 unit of corn capital worked up by some member of 5, producing 1 unit of corn, gross. Out of that, V2 unit reproduces his capital and he pays a wage of V3 unit of corn/day x V2 day = V6 unit of corn, which leaves a profit for him of 1/3 unit of corn. He must go elsewhere to produce the other ¥3 units of corn he needs, for his capital stock is tied up. To earn the additional corn he requires, he uses the Farm technology and works for 2 days, producing ¥3 units of corn. Thus, he, too, ends up working exactly 2 days, reproducing his capital stock and having 1 unit of corn left for consumption. The second equilibrium is exactly the same with regard to the labor- corn allocation as the first one. Each person works 2 days, reproduces his or her capital stock, and consumes 1 unit of corn. But the class structure differs from that of the first equilibrium. Every producer just works for himself in the first equilibrium; there is only one class of self-employed producers and no division of labor. In the second equilibrium there are two classes-H and 5-and there is a complete social division of labor. 50me work only on the Farm and some only in the Factory. The Origin of Exploitation 19 What is a class? That is best seen from the model. It is a group of people, all of whom relate to the labor market in the same way. In the first equilibrium each person is a self-employed peasant, or artisan. In the second equilibrium 250 people are sellers of labor power (and also work for themselves part time) and 750 people are hirers of labor power (and also work for themselves part time). A more precise definition of class will be given in Chapter 4. Note that in both of these equilibria each person works just socially necessary labor time. Indeed, given the preferences of agents in this model, no one has any reason to prefer one equilibrium over the other. For in each equilibrium each person works 2 days and consumes 1 unit of corn. This indifference between the equilibria follows because the only arguments of the utility function of people in this society are leisure and corn. No person has any preference for rural life over urban life or vice versa. Nor does anyone care whether she works for herself or for a boss. But suppose that working for a boss is a source of disutility; that is, labor performed for hire is more unpleasant than labor performed for oneself. In that case it would no longer be correct to say people cared just about corn and leisure: they would care about corn and the various types of labor they expend-labor expended on one’s own account being of a different type from labor expended for someone else. Were this the case, the second equilibrium outlined would not be an equilibrium, because members of 5 would prefer to work autarkically, as in the first equilibrium, rather than work for a boss. Given this preference, would it still be possible to arrange an equilibrium involving the two classes Hand S? The wage rate would have to be higher them V3 unit of corn per day to compensate a member of 5 for expending labor under a boss, an activity that she now finds relatively distasteful. But if that were so, the hirer’s profits would fall, and he would have to work longer than 2 days on the Farm to get all the corn he needs. What would entice him to do that? Nothing-unless, perversely, he receives utility from being a boss over someone, or unless he has a preference for rural life over urban life. If hirers have preferences of this sort, then indeed one could have an equilibrium with a complete social division of labor, but with slightly different outcomes than those described in the second equilibrium above. Conditions other than disutilities involving types of labor expended can motivate a social division of labor. Suppose there are setup costs in moving from the Farm to the Factory, because it takes time to move. Then, in fact, the autarkic equilibrium discussed above is 20 The Origin of Exploitation not achievable, for when each person moves from Farm to Factory, he uses up some time. It would require 2 days plus set-up time to produce 1 unit of corn by oneself. If these set-up costs exist, it would be to the advantage of society to minimize them, by having one group work only in the Factory and the other only on the Farm. This is, in fact, what the second equilibrium accomplishes. With set-up costs, one would observe only the second equilibrium, because the autarkic solution would not be Pareto optimal: everyone could be rendered better off by the social division of labor, because only by specializing could each person acquire 1 unit of corn for consumption for 2 days of labor. Thus, despite the class structure of this equilibrium, the result is completely egalitarian in terms of the corn consumed and the labor expended by members of the society. So a class structure is not ipso facto associated with inequality of final welfare. 2.2 The Technical Definition of Exploitation Exploitation is said to exist if in a given economy some agents must work more time than is socially necessary (longer than the socially necessary labor time) to earn their consumption bundles and others work less time than is socially necessary to earn their bundles. Exploitation does not exist in the economy described in Section 2.1, because everyone works precisely socially necessary labor time. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that class differentiation can emerge without exploitation, at least at this level of theoretical abstraction. That is the lesson of the second equilibrium, which has the two classes Hand S. However, without the kind of set-up costs referred to above, the class structure is rather ephemeral: it is not forced into existence, for society could just as well organize itself as it does in the autarkic equilibrium, that is, in an undifferentiated way. Class structure becomes interesting, and conforms more to Marxist expectation, when there is no other way for society to organize itself to achieve an equilibrium. 2.3 Unequal Ownership of the Capital Stock What happens when a society is organized with unequal ownership of the capital stock (in this model, capital stock is the seed corn)? Instead of the equal distribution posited in Section 2.1, suppose that The Origin of Exploitation 21 each of 10 agents (call them rich agents I, 2, 3, . . . , 10) owns 50 units of corn and the other 990 own none. The only productive asset these last own is their labor power, the capacity to work. This economy also differs from that described in Section 2.1 in another way, namely, that each person’s utility function is strictly increasing in corn. In other words, if he can get more corn without expending additional labor, then he wishes to do so. A person having subsistence preferences is not indifferent to getting more than 1 unit of corn, he simply is not willing to expend more of his own time to get more corn. Should more corn come his way for nothing, he is happy to accept it. Otherwise, all features of the economy (preferences for leisure time and technologies) are the same as before. What is the eqUilibrium in this economy with the skewed initial distribution of seed corn? First 1 will try the obvious autarkic arrangement. Each of the propertyless agents (I will call them peasants) works 3 days on the Farm, to get 1 unit of corn. Each of the propertied agents works up 1 unit of corn of his capital stock, producing 1 unit of corn, net, at the end of the week, which he consumes. Thus, each of the rich agents I, 2,. . . , 10 works 1 day and each of the other 990 agents works 3 days. This arrangement would be a case of exploitation, but it is not an equilibrium. There is exploitation in this society because the socially necessary labor time for this society is 2 days of labor. That calculation does not change as the distribution of corn changes, because the calculation of socially necessary labor time is independent of the distribution of assets. It depends only on total consumption, technology, and the total amount of capital and labor available. (If the needs of people, or their demands, were to change with the redistribution of wealth, the story would be more complicated.) But this arrangement is not an equilibrium. The rich agents can do better for themselves, without the poor ones doing any worse. Using a labor market, a deal can be struck. Each rich agent can become a capitalist and offer to hire labor. As before, the rich agents constitute the class H. Each rich agent has a lot of unused seed corn in the preceding solution. Suppose each rich person offers to hire peasants to work up his capital stock in the Factory technology-at a wage rate of 2 days of labor for 1 unit of corn (that is, V2 unit of corn per day). Then all 990 peasants will flock to the Factory gates to work, for that is a better deal than working on the Farm, at a rate of 3 days of labor for 1 unit of corn. Each peasant will wish to supply 2 days of labor (and 22 The Origin of Exploitation thereby earn his needed 1 unit of corn). But, to put this supply of labor to work in the Factory requires 2 x 990 = 1,980 units of seed corn, an amount that is not available. Thus, at the wage rate just proposed, the supply of labor far exceeds the demand for the labor by the capitalists. Hence, V:z unit of corn per day is not an equilibrium wage. The capitalists can lower the wage from V2 unit of corn per day, because the supply of labor exceeds the demand for labor at that proposed wage. How far will they lower it? The alternative for a peasant is to work at a real wage of V3 unit of corn per day on the Farm. So long as the Factory wage is higher than that, all peasants will flock to the Factory. But there is not enough capital stock to produce the subsistence needs of this population using only the Factory. Therefore, no wage higher than V3 unit of corn per day can be sustained. Furthermore, no wage lower than V3 unit of corn per day can be sustained, for at a wage lower than V3 unit of corn per day no labor will be offered; all peasants will prefer to stay peasants, earning their livelihood on the Farm. Hence, the only possible wage that can clear the labor market is 1/3 unit of corn per day (3 days of labor for 1 unit of corn). At this wage each peasant is indifferent to working on the Farm or in the Factory, because the real wage is the same in both places. Hence, the labor supplied at the wage 1/3 unit of corn per day is anything between 0 days and 3 x 990 = 2,970 days. That is, each peasant, and there are 990 of them, is willing to work any amount of labor from 0 to 3 days for a capitalist at the wage of V3 unit of corn per day. Figure 2.1 shows the supply and demand curves of labor in this economy. An equilibrium can be arranged as follows. The capitalists hire exactly the number of peasants required to utilize fully their capital stock. This requires 500 days of labor, or 500/3 peasants, each of whom becomes a”factory worker” and earns 1 unit of corn for 3 days of labor. The other 823.33 (990 - 500/3) peasants stay as peasants on the Farm and earn their subsistence bundle of corn there. The capitalists, as a class, work 0 days; the workers in their factories produce 1,000 units of corn, of which 500 units replace the seed stock, 500/3 units is paid out as wages, and the remaining ~3 x 500 = 333.33 units of corn are profits. Thus, each capitalist gets 33.3 units of corn as profit in this equilibrium, and does not work at all. He can certainly consume his needed 1 unit of corn, or even much more than that. Or he can accumulate corn. In the equilibrium in this model, there are three classes: capitalists, who do not work but only hire others and reap profits; workers, who The Origin of Exploitation 23 w ~ ~<sub>r—————</sub> L….–+——-…….,.—3~J: t&gt; I 500 2970 Figure 2.1 Equilibrium in the peasant economy.

Each worker and peasant works for 3 days to earn 1 unit of com. But I concluded earlier that the amount of labor embodied in 1 unit of com is 2 days, given the demands of this society. So exploitation has emerged in this model, because capitalists work less than socially necessary labor time, whereas the workers and the peasants work more than socially necessary labor time. 2.4 The Causes of Exploitation What are the features of the economy described in the preceding section that have caused exploitation to emerge? Two are worthy of mention: the scarcity of capital relative to the labor available for it to employ; and differential ownership of the capital stock. The second feature has already been emphasized by the comparison of the models of Sections 2.1 and 2.3; exploitation has emerged with the differential ownership of the capital stock. But what effect does scarcity of capital have? Capital is relatively scarce in the economy described in Section 2.3. By this I mean that it is impossible for the society to “reproduce itself economically” (that is, to produce 1,000 units of com, net, in a week) 24 The Origin of Exploitation using only the Factory technology, because it lacks the necessary capital stock to do so. Suppose, on the other hand, that capital is abundant-say, the total endowment of capital is 5,000 units of corn instead of 500, and that each capitalist owns 500 units of seed corn. What would happen when the wage rate offered is 3 days of labor for 1 unit of corn? I have computed that at most 3 x 990 = 2,970 days of labor will be offered, which can be used in conjunction with 2,970 units of seed corn in the Factory, but there is much more seed corn lying around. Capitalists will start to compete with each other; one thinks that if he raises the real wage a bit, he will attract more labor, thereby using all his capital stock and reaping much more profit than he currently gets. Hence, the real wage rate will rise, essentially to the point where profits are zero. It will rise to the rate of 1 unit of corn per day’s labor, at which rate the capitalists make zero profits, and no one works on the Farm. (In fact, this is a simplification; it will rise to some value a bit less than 1 unit of corn per day, so that the capitalists can earn at least some of their own consumption bundle. But this is a detail that is not important for my story.) If capital is sufficiently abundant relative to the labor available for it to employ, then the profit rate drops and exploitation virtually disappears. Of course, socially necessary labor time decreases in this economy as the capital to labor ratio rises, because it becomes possible to produce 1,000 units of corn with much less labor. With K = 5,000, socially necessary labor time per individual is 1 day of labor, because society does not need to use the Farm at all. The essential aspect of capital is that it is an input to production that cannot be instantaneously produced. It must already exist in order for it to be used in the present. Thus, either it was produced in the past (as I assumed the seed corn was) or it is a nonproduced factor (like land or some natural resource). (The incomes that accrue to owners of capital that was produced in the past are often called profits, whereas the incomes to owners of natural resources that were never produced are called rents.) When capital (whether it was produced in the past or is an appropriated natural resource) becomes private property and is distributed in an inegalitarian manner, differentiation and exploitation arise, through the market process. Recall that the sense in which the exploitation that occurs here is a technical, but not obviously an ethical, one. It is not clear that the factory workers who are exploited in the equilibrium described in this section are being unfairly taken advantage of (or being exploited in The Origin of Exploitation 25 the colloquial sense) unless one had some reason to believe that the initial unequal distribution of the capital stock that gave rise to that exploitation is unfair. 2.5 The Industrial Reserve Army In Marxist parlance, the excess of labor relative to capital is supplied by what is called the industrial reserve army. That army consists of the people who are potentially in the work force and can be employed by capital but are working lion the Farm,” that is, on the margins of the capitalist sector. It is their existence that, in this story, keeps the wage rate down to its subsistence level-and profits at a maximum. The most proximate source of this industrial reserve army is the unemployed, and for this reason, Marxism views unemployment as a necessary condition for maintaining a “good investment climate,” that is, a profit rate sufficiently high to induce capitalists to invest. Many Marxists have claimed that, because it is in the interests of the capitalist class to have an industrial reserve army, capitalism creates such an army, that is, that it deliberately maintains unemployment. Perhaps it does through monetary and fiscal policies. If so, those policies must be policies of the state. Whether maintenance of a pool of unemployed workers is a deliberate policy of the capitalist state is a subject of research and contention. A second source of the industrial reserve army is a pool of migrant workers. If the labor market becomes international and workers can move across borders in search of employment, then capitalists can hold down the real wage by importing workers from other countries, from what has been called the agricultural periphery. Or, alternatively, capital can move to where the workers are. Capital movement has become a very real phenomenon in the United States during the past twenty years as industry formerly located in the United States has moved to Southeast Asia, an area with cheap labor. The effect of this movement has been a reduction of the real wage of workers in the United States. This is not necessarily a bad thing: Do workers in the United States have any more right of access to the capital stock, and employment, than workers in Southeast Asia who were otherwise (perhaps at best) employed on subsistence “farms”? The hypocrisy of capitalists with respect to “illegal aliens” is explained by the effect these workers have as an industrial reserve 26 The Origin of Exploitation army. On the one hand, capitalists do not want the supply of such workers cut off; on the other hand, it is in their interest for the workers to be maintained in an illegal status, for that tends to keep them subservient on the job. The optimal policy for capitalists is therefore to maintain a pool of illegal workers and to have the illegality only mildly enforced. An example of this policy in action is provided by an article by Robert Pear in the New York Times (January 23, 1986) headlined “Reagan’s advisers say bill on aliens can hurt economy.” The Council on Economic Advisers reported to Reagan that punishing employers for hiring illegal aliens would have adverse effects on the nation’s economy. The report says that the presence of low-skilled foreign workers in the United States “enables domestic business enterprises to produce goods profitably that would not otherwise have been produced here.” 2.6 Concluding Comments One might ask how realistic the models of Sections 2.1 and 2.3 are as schemata approximating capitalism. For instance, it does not seem as if there are two technologies today. Do people have an alternative like the Farm, where they can go to produce their consumption needs outside of the capitalist sector? There might be several approximations to the Farm, or institutions that take the place of the Farm, in modern capitalism. Some of these are associated with the state: unemployment insurance and welfare assistance may provide the alternative that sets a lower bound on the real wage. But the image of a Farm to return to, as an alternative, is not a real one in modern capitalist society, and the real wage must indeed be set by some procedure more complicated than the one in these models. Before discussing the exploitation that has emerged in the society in Section 2.3, and whether or not it is a bad thing, I want to point out that the phenomenon is one that can exist in a perfectly competitive situation. First of all, there is no cheating or coercion in the model. Nor is there any collusion on the part of capitalists. In this sense, exploitation in the technical sense-that some live off the labor of others by virtue of their possession of capital-is a phenomenon that emerges in a model with competitive markets. For Marx, it was important to explain this feature of capitalism. How could accumulation take place and capital be concentrated systematically in the hands of a The Origin of Exploitation 27 small class without cheating or coercion, or in what one would today call a regime of perfect competition? The question becomes interesting when one observes that the concentration of wealth in the hands of the landed gentry under feudalism was accomplished only with coercion. Notice, as well, that in this model exploitation and the unequal distribution of income are not the consequence of people having different preferences: everyone has the same preferences. This may not be an accurate depiction of the world; the point is, exploitation and inequality result even under that stringent assumption. Thus, exploitation in this model cannot be explained by the existence of different kinds of people-unless it is the differences between people, unalluded to here, that explain why they started off with different amounts of capital. The internal differences between people that might explain differential wealth will be the topic of Chapter 5. Finally, I want to point out the differences between the equilibria of the models of Sections 2.1 and 2.3. The first difference is in the initial distribution of the capital stock. In the model of Section 2.1 there is no essential class distinction, whereas in the model of Section 2.3 there are three distinct classes, defined in terms of how they relate to the selling and hiring of labor. In the model of Section 2.1 there is no exploitation at equilibrium, whereas in the model of Section 2.3 there is. Finally, and this is a point I have not emphasized until now, in the model of Section 2.1 there is no accumulation of capital, whereas in the model of Section 2.3 there is. Thus, in the model of Section 2.1 precisely the consumption needs of the population are produced at equilibrium, and the society ends up at the beginning of the next week in exactly the same situation as that at the beginning of the first week. In the model of Section 2.3, however, each capitalist makes 33.3 units of corn profits. If I assume that he consumes just 1 unit of corn, then he begins the second week, not with 50 units of corn, but with 82.3 units of corn. Thus, there are three essential consequences of the differential ownership of the capital stock: the emergence of exploitation, class, and accumulation.</p>
