# Exploitation and Profits

This chapter presents a simple, algebraic model that formalizes some
of the concepts presented in the models of Chapter 2. I will define
embodied labor value, exploitation, and the profit rate and then investigate
the relationship between exploitation and profits.
4.1 Embodied Labor and Exploitation
Imagine a corn economy with just one technology, that called the
Factory in Chapter 2. One unit of corn, gross, can be produced using
a units of corn as input and L days of labor. Thus, the technology can
be summarized
{a,L} ~ 1,
or, in terms of net corn production,
{a,L} ~ 1 - a.
Clearly, for this technology to be productive, a must be less than 1.
Otherwise, stocks would dwindle to zero.
The labor embodied in a unit of corn is defined as the amount of labor
that is necessary to produce 1 unit of corn, including the labor needed
to reproduce the corn input used in the process. To derive this quantity,
let x be the amount of corn that would have to be produced in
order to end up with 1 unit of corn after replacing the corn input used
in the production of x. Because the technology is assumed to exhibit
constant returns to scale, the production of x units of corn requires an
input ofaxj to end up with 1 unit of corn, net, x must satisfy
x=ax+1. (4.1)
Exploitation and Profits 37
Equation (4.1) can be read as "gross output = input used + net
output." Solving (4.1) for x gives
1
x = -1--a-.
The amount of labor needed to produce this amount of corn is, there
fore,
L
1 - a == A. (4.2)
A is the labor embodied in a unit of corn.
There is a useful interpretation of (4.2). Because a < 1, we can
expand the expression L/(1 - a) as a geometric series:
A = L + La + La2 + La3 + . . . (4.3)
In (4.3), the first term L is the direct, live labor expended today to
produce 1 unit of corn, gross. But we must replace the seed corn,
used in amount a. The labor that had to be expended last week to
produce a unit of seed corn for use this week was La, the second term.
But, how much seed input was needed two weeks ago, to plant then,
so as to have a units of corn available last week? Precisely a2 units of
corn, and that required expending, two weeks ago, La2 units of direct
labor. In this way, the expression (4.3) decomposes the labor embodied
in a unit of corn into the direct labor expended at various
times in the past to produce the inputs needed to produce the inputs
needed to produce the inputs needed, and so on forever back into the
past, to produce the corn today.
There is another useful derivation of the labor embodied in a unit of
corn. The embodied labor value of a good is the sum of live labor
expended during the current production period to produce the good,
plus the labor already embodied in the inputs used in production. Let
A stand for the embodied labor value in a unit of corn. The labor
expended today in producing corn is L, and the labor embodied in the
a units of corn used as an input in corn's production is, by definition,
Aa, because A is the labor content of 1 unit of corn. Thus, by the
second sentence of this paragraph,
A = L + Aa. (4.4)
Solving Equation (4.4) for A yields, again, Equation (4.2).
38 Exploitation and Profits
The expression (4.2) looks very much like the multiplier in macroeconomics,
and this is no accident. Recall that
Y = C + I (gross output = consumption + investment)
C = aY + d (consumption function).
Combining these two equations yields
y=d+1
1 - a·
The interpretation is the same as that given for expression (4.2). An
increase in investment from I to I + 111 increases national income, not
by M, but by 111/(1 - a), where a is the propensity to consume. An
increase in investment of 111 leads to an increased consumption of
a111; in tum, those consumption expenditures generate additional incomes
of aM, and people receiving that income increase their consumption
by a2111, and so on into the future. Thus, the decomposition
~ = 111 + aM + a2111 + . . . 1 - a
has the same sort of interpretation, going into the future, as the
decomposition of Equation (4.3) does going into the past.
Socially necessary labor time is defined as the amount of labor embodied
in the bundle that the worker consumes, a bundle that he
purchases with his wage. Suppose that the daily subsistence amount
of com that a worker consumes in this economy is b units of com. If
the wage is a subsistence wage, then his entire wage is spent on
purchasing this amount of com. Thus, socially necessary labor time is
defined as
SNLT == lI.b = 1 ~ a· (4.5)
Notice that this definition is slightly different from that in Chapter 2,
where the total capital stock available was considered and socially
necessary labor time was an appropriate average of labor time expended
in the Factory and Farm sectors. In this model, which has no
Farm sector, I do not have that option. Although the definitions are
different, the end result will be about the same, and one should not
worry about this detail, except to acknowledge its existence.
Suppose labor time is denominated in days of labor. There is some
Exploitation and Profits 39
fixed length of the working day, by hypothesis; and, by definition,
the worker works for 1 day in order to receive his wage, which is w.
The wage can be paid in either corn or money. The worker is said to
be exploited if the amount of corn he can purchase with his daily
wage embodies less than 1 day, the amount of time the worker toiled
to earn the wage. If the daily wage just suffices to purchase corn in
amount b, then the worker is exploited if
Ab < 1.
The rate of exploitation is defined as
1 - Ab
e=---
Ab (4.6)
In other words, e is the ratio of surplus labor time expended by the
worker to socially necessary labor time. The surplus labor time is that
portion of the daily labor that the worker expends above that embodied
in the corn he is paid. It becomes embodied in corn that ends
up as profits for the capitalist, as I will show in the next section.
4.2 Prices and the Profit Rate
Suppose a unit of corn sells for a price of p, denominated in some
currency. Then the fact that the wage in this model is a subsistence
one is summarized by
pb = w. (4.7)
The amount the worker must pay to buy his corn bundle is just his
wage.
For each unit of corn the capitalist produces, she must pay pa + wL
for her inputs of corn and labor. I assume she pays the wage at the
beginning of the production period (which may not be realistic), so
wage costs are considered to be part of her investment costs. (But
nothing of significance changes if the capitalist pays the workers at
the end of the production period.) Then the profits per unit of corn
that a capitalist makes, because I assume she is able to sell her corn at
the going price, are
p - (pa + wL) = unit profits.
40 Exploitation and Profits
The profit rate, 7T, is defined as the rate at which her investment
grows; it is the ratio of profits to investment. Thus,
7T = P - (pa + wL) (4.8)
pa + wL .
Rewriting (4.8) in a more convenient form yields
p = (1 + 7T)(pa + wL). (4.9)
The capitalist in this model wishes to expand her stock of capital.
She is not the same sort of subsistence agent discussed in Chapter 2.
Her preferences, for whatever reason, are for accumulation and dictate
that she expand her capital stock as rapidly as possible. I will not
inquire into what social norms or other constraints or forces give rise
to these preferences in capitalists. Suffice it to say that competition
among capitalists forces each to expand as rapidly as possible in order
to have the funds to innovate and not be driven out of the market
altogether. So in this model I will simply assume that capitalists strive
to accumulate. The measure of the rate of the capitalist's accumulation
is 7T, the profit rate. It is the rate at which investment capital
expands from one period to the next.
In summary, the data of the model are {a,L,b}. These are given,
exogenous magnitudes. The endogenous variables, determined by
the data, are e, A, p, and 7T. Notice that I have left out w. There is one
degree of freedom in the model, because there are more unknowns
than equations. Equation (4.2) defines A from the data and Equation
(4.6) defines e. I am left with Equations (4.7) and (4.9) to determine p,
w, and 7T. This cannot be done uniquely, because only relative prices
matter. I therefore have the liberty to set either p or w at some arbitrary
level, and I have chosen to set w = 1. Hence, the price p is the
price of com relative to the wage, or the wage-price of com.
4.3 The Relationship between Exploitation and Profits
One can solve for the rate of profit in terms of the data. Substituting
from Equation (4.7) into (4.9) and dividing through by p yields
1
1 + 7T = a + bL. (4.10)
The expression a + bL is called the augmented input coefficient. The first
term, a, is the amount of com that must be planted in the ground to
yield 1 unit of com. The second term, bL, is the amount of com that
Exploitation and Profits 41
must be fed into the worker to yield 1 unit of corn. Hence, from a
technological point of view, a + bL is the amount of corn that must be
used as input, in one way or another, in the production of 1 unit of
corn. If there are to be any profits, this augmented input coefficient
had better be less than the amount of corn produced,
a + bL < 1. (4.11)
And from (4.10), this is just the condition necessary to generate a
positive value for the rate of profit, 1f'.
Thus, the condition summarized by inequality (4.11) is required for
generating a positive rate of profit. What is the condition for generating
a positive rate of exploitation? It is, by reference to the definition
of e in Equation (4.6),
Ab < 1. (4.12)
But by the derivation of the formula (4.5) for socially necessary labor
time, (4.12) is equivalent to
bL
-1 - < 1 or a + bL < 1, -a
which is just condition (4.11), the necessary and sufficient condition
for a positive rate of profit. Thus, condition (4.11) is necessary and
sufficient both for the rate of profit to be positive and for the rate of
exploitation to be positive. This is summarized by the following
theorem.
Theorem 4.1 1f' > 0 if and only if e > o.
In other words, the necessary and sufficient condition for the existence
of a positive profit rate is that labor be exploited. Some writers
have called this the fundamental Marxian theorem (Morishima, 1973).
(I do not think it is really so fundamental, for reasons I will mention
later.) The theorem verifies the intuition, mentioned earlier, that surplus
labor becomes embodied as profits. It is only by virtue of the fact
that workers are paid a wage enabling them to buy only an amount of
corn embodying less labor than they expended in production that
some corn is left over for capitalists. Whether the capitalists consume
this surplus, or sell it to buyers other than workers, or invest it, is not
my present concern.
Theorem 4.1 shows that profits are positive if and only if workers
are exploited. But what makes it possible for capitalists to exploit
42 Exploitation and Profits
workers? Why should the corn wage, b, not rise until the profit rate
falls to zero? The answer to this question is provided in Chapter 2.
Capitalists own scarce capital-in this case, seed corn-which is
needed for production. Recall that the technology {a,L} in this model
is like the Factory technology of Chapter 2. Because of the scarcity of
seed corn (which is owned by the capitalists) relative to the labor
available for hire, workers compete for access to the technology, a
situation keeping their wage low enough to maintain a positive rate of
profit. In other words, the wage is bid down to just the amount
required by the worker as a consequence of competition among the
workers for employment on the scarce capital stock. Nothing in the
story requires that the corn wage of workers be a subsistence wage in
any biological sense. As long as labor is sufficiently abundant relative
to the capital that is available to employ it, the wage rate will settle at
some level that permits a positive rate of profit. At any such wage
rate, exploitation occurs.
4.4 An Economy with Many Produced Goods
One weakness of the model presented thus far is that it does not
provide for a division of labor among workers. Everybody produces
only corn and consumes only corn. The social division of labor can be
exhibited only in a model in which many goods are produced. To
analyze such a model requires some linear algebra. But, in the final
analysis, the result is just the same as Theorem 4.1: profits exist if and
only if there is exploitation.
Assume that there are n goods and that x represents a vector in Rn
of levels of production of these n goods. The technology is summarized
by the data {A,L}, where A is an n x n input coefficient matrix.
The j th column of A, Aj , lists the amounts of the n goods needed as
inputs into the production of 1 unit of the j th good. Thus, in the
matrix A = (aij), aij is the amount of the ith good used as input in
production of 1 unit of the jth good. L is a row vector of n components,
L = (Lj ), where Lj is the amount of direct labor needed as input
in producing 1 unit of good j.
4.4.1 The Vector of Embodied Labor Values
Let the subsistence vector of consumption be the n-vector b. No
longer do people consume just corn. Then the labor embodied in b is
Exploitation and Profits 43
the amount of labor necessary to produce b as a net output. Thus,
using reasoning similar to the reasoning prior to Equation (4.1), I
search for the vector of gross outputs x that will produce b as its net
output,
x = Ax + b. (4.13)
(If x is the vector of gross output, then Ax is the vector of inputs
consumed in the process and b is the vector of net output. Equation
(4.13) is of the form, gross output = input + final demand.)
Let 1 be the n x n identity matrix. If (I - A) is invertible, then the
solution to (4.13) is
(4.14)
Indeed, a well-known theorem of linear algebra states that (1 - A) is
invertible and its inverse is a nonnegative matrix if A is a productive
matrix. A productive matrix is one capable of producing a vector of
positive net outputs. This is an eminently reasonable economic condition
to require of A. The amount of labor that must be expended to
produce x (namely, Lx, the scalar product of L and x) is just
SNLT(b) = L(I - A)-Ib, (4.15)
or the socially necessary labor time.
Equation (4.15) is the vector analogue of Equation (4.5). As one
might guess, the expression L(I - A)-I, which is a row vector with n
components, is the expression for the vector of embodied labor values,
A, embodied in the n commodities in the economy; and Equation
(4.15) can be written as
SNLT(b) = Ab, (4.16)
which looks like the first part of Equation (4.5).
Indeed, this expression can be derived for the vector of embodied
labor values in commodities, A, by an argument like the one leading
to Equation (4.4). Let A be the vector of embodied labor, or labor
values. Then a typical component Aj of A is the sum of labor expended
in the present production period in the production of commodity
j, and labor embodied in the inputs manufactured in the past,
but used today, in the production of commodity j. The first term of
direct labor is the component Lj of L; the expression for labor embodied
in the inputs used to produce commodity j is
AIaIj + A2a2j + ... + Ananj,
44 Exploitation and Profits
which is the scalar product of A with Aj , the j th column of A. Thus,
Aj = Lj + AAj • (4.17)
Writing Equation (4.17) as a vector equation, for all j, gives
A = L + AA. (4.18)
Equation (4.18) is the vector analogue of Equation (4.4). It can be
solved for A by inverting the matrix (I - A). Hence,
A = L(I - A)-l
as conjectured. It follows that Equation (4.16) is another way of writing
Equation (4.15).
As in the corn model, an agent is defined as exploited if socially
necessary labor time is less than the amount of time he works, assuming
his daily wage only allows him to purchase the vector of consumption
b. The labor embodied in the vector b is
A1b1 + Azbz + . . . + Anbn = Ab,
and so the condition for exploitation of the worker is
Ab < 1.
The rate of exploitation is defined as before,
1 - Ab e = --:-::--
Ab
(4.19)
and has the same interpretation, namely, the ratio of surplus labor
time in the working day to the labor embodied in the worker's daily
consumption bundle.
4.4.2 Prices
The derivation of prices in the multidimensional model requires an
additional argument: I must invoke the fact that capitalists compete.
There are now n possible sectors to invest in, but a capitalist will only
invest in lines of production that achieve the maximal profit rate, for
no other line will expand his capital so rapidly. Let p be the n-dimensional
row vector of prices of goods. (Recall that in Section 4.1 the
daily wage was set at 1 and that Aj is the jth column of A.) Then the
cost of inputs and labor to produce 1 unit of good j is
pAj + Lj,
Exploitation and Profits 45
and hence the profit rate, at prices p, of producing good j is
po - (pA + Lo)
1To == J _ I I (4.20)
J pAj + Lj .
I have argued that only those processes that achieve the maximal
profit rate will be operated. Suppose that in this economy all the
sectors must operate (perhaps in order to produce the subsistence
requirements and the inputs required for that purpose). Then the
economy cannot be considered to be in a long-run equilibrium unless
prices are such that all sectors generate the maximal profit rate and all
goods are produced. Hence, at such an equilibrium, the profit rates
are equalized across all sectors; I will call that uniform profit rate 1T.
The price equation can be deduced from (4.20):
p = (1 + 1T)(pA + L), (4.21)
which is a vector equation stating that the vector p is proportional in
its components to the vector (pA + L), with a constant of proportionality
(1 + 1T).
As before, the subsistence wage equation can be written as
pb = 1, (4.22)
which states that workers must expend their entire daily wage to
purchase the daily subsistence requirement b. Substituting from
(4.22) into (4.21) and factoring p out of the right-hand side yields
p = (1 + 1T)p(A + bL), (4.23)
where A + bL is the augmented input coefficient matrix. Note that bL is
the product of a column vector with a row vector, each of length n; so
it is an n X n matrix. Indeed the ij th component of A + bL, which is
ajj + bjLj, is just the total amount of good i that enters into production
of good j when one considers not only the factor input that occurs
directly (ajj), but also the input of good i that enters indirectly into
good j through the worker's consumption. This last amount is bjLj and
is called the labor-feeding input coefficient.
A theorem of linear algebra known as the Frobenius-Perron theorem
asserts that if the matrix (A + bL) is productive, in the sense
defined earlier, then a unique nonnegative price vector p and an
associated profit rate 1T that solve Equation (4.23) exist. Thus, prices
capable of reproducing this economy exist, so long as the technological
and subsistence data {A,L,b} render the augmented technology
(A + bL) capable of producing a surplus.
46 Exploitation and Profits
4.4.3 Exploitation and Profits in a Multidimensional Model
Equation (4.15) and the definition of the rate of exploitation yield the
condition for a positive rate of exploitation:
(4.24)
I have remarked that p and 7T are uniquely determined, given A, b,
and L, by Equation (4.23). Hence it should be possible to investigate
whether there is a relationship between the condition for a positive
rate of exploitation, as given by (4.24), and the existence of a positive
rate of profit. Indeed, using the Frobenius-Perron theorem one can
prove the following theorem.
Theorem 4.2 In the n-dimensional model, 7T > 0 if and only if e > o.
The result is the same as that of the simple corn model. A positive rate
of profit is sustainable in a reproducible economic system if and only
if workers are exploited, in the sense that the labor embodied in the
goods they can purchase with their wage is less than the labor they
expend. The proof of Theorem 4.2 is given in the Appendix.
4.5 The Social Division of Labor and the
Perception of Exploitation
In Chapter 3 I presented the notion that capitalism and feudalism
share a common trait, namely, the extraction of a surplus by a small
class of property owners from a large class of direct producers. This
view is verified by Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 of the last two sections.
According to these theorems, profits exist because workers only
spend part of the working day working for themselves; the rest of the
day they work to produce the profits of the capitalist. Under feudalism
this separation of work time between necessary and surplus time
was observable by the producer, but such is not the case under capitalism,
because of the social division of labor and the production of
commodities.
A worker does not actually produce the goods b that he consumes.
Suppose that he produces auto fenders all day long. Further suppose
that the auto worker works 40 hours a week producing fenders, but
the wages he is paid enable him to buy consumption goods embodying
only 20 hours of labor (expended mostly by other workers). BeExploitation
and Profits 47
cause of the social division of labor, he has no clear conception of the
amount of labor that is necessary to produce the goods he consumes.
For the auto worker, the division of his labor time is not apparent. For
the serf under feudalism, however, the work week, or work year, was
clearly divided into labor time expended in the production of his
subsistence commodities and labor time expended directly for the
lord. Thus, the social division of labor-the arrangement by which no
worker in modem capitalism produces all the goods that make up his
consumption bundle-obscures the relation of exploitation between
capitalist and worker.
A commodity is defined as a good produced for exchange, not for
the producer's own use. Capitalist production, unlike most production
under feudalism, is commodity production. And commodity
production is clearly related to the existence of the social division of
labor. It could therefore be said that the system of commodity production
is responsible for obscuring the nature of exploitation in a capitalist
economy.
4.6 The Labor Theory of Value
Associated with the classical economists Smith and Ricardo, and also
with Marx, is the claim that prices in a market economy are a reflection
of the embodied labor values of commodities. In its starkest form
this assertion is interpreted to mean that prices are proportional to
labor values; that is, that the vector p is proportional to the vector A.
In fact, Marx did not assert this "labor theory of value." Rather he
used it as an approximation to simplify his arguments about exploitation,
because he (rightly) believed that the deviations of prices from
embodied labor values were not relevant to his theory of exploitation.
The price vector p that solves Equation (4.23) is not proportional to
the vector A that solves Equation (4.18), except in certain unusual
circumstances (either when the profit rate is zero, or when the technology
exhibits a singular property known as equal "organic compositions
of capital"). Nevertheless, as I have shown in this chapter, the
relationship between exploitation and profits does not depend on the
proportionality of labor values to prices, and so nothing of substance
is lost by acknowledging that the labor theory of value is false.
Then why did classical economists put some stock in the claim that
exchange values, or prices, would be proportional to labor values?
48 Exploitation and Profits
Imagine a society that produces deer and beaver, as in Adam Smith's
example. In this society everyone needs or wants to consume the
same consumption bundle of venison and beaver pelts-say, 1 unit of
venison and 1 beaver pelt. Suppose that it takes 6 days to hunt a deer
and produce 1 unit of venison ready for trade or consumption and 3
days to produce 1 beaver pelt. Suppose that all labor is equally skilled
at either occupation and can move freely between the venison and
beaver pelt industries. But suppose further that set-up costs are such
that there is a social division of labor, so people must trade with one
another to end up with their desired consumption bundle. Suppose
that people have subsistence preferences and want to minimize their
labor expended in hunting. What will the equilibrium price ratio be
between venison and beaver pelts?
It will be 2. At that price ratio, each person, regardless of occupation,
will spend 9 days hunting, and each will end up with his desired
consumption bundle. If the price ratio were higher than 2 everyone
would want to move into the venison industry, in an attempt to
reduce their hunting times. More realistically, some beaver trappers
would start to move into the venison industry, thereby producing an
oversupply of venison and driving down its price. If the price ratio
were less than 2, producers would move into the beaver pelt industry.
Thus, the only price ratio that can support the production of both
venison and beaver pelts is 2. Note that 2 is also the ratio of the
embodied labor of venison to the embodied labor of beaver pelts,
because those labor times are 6 days and 3 days, respectively. Thus,
equilibrium prices are proportional to embodied labor values.
In the deer-beaver model, the labor theory of value is true. It fails
to be true, however, once capital stock is introduced into the economy-
so long as the capital stock is scarce relative to the hunters who
would use it. Suppose that hunting a beaver requires traps and that
hunting a deer requires bows and arrows and that these implements
take a fairly long time to make. A hunter who does not already own
traps or bows cannot devote time to making them, because it takes so
long to do so that he would not have time to earn his consumption
bundle and would starve. Now, suppose that there is a capital stock
of bows and traps owned by a class of agents who had them made in
the past, from their accumulated surpluses. These capitalists today
will hire trappers to use the traps and bows to hunt beaver and deer
and will pay them wages in return. If there is a scarcity of traps and
bows relative to the trappers who would use them, then the wage of
trappers will be bid down to that amount needed to purchase only
Exploitation and Profits 49
their "subsistence" bundle of 1 beaver pelt and 1 unit of venison. The
embodied labor of both beaver pelts and venison must now include
an element that takes into account the depreciation of the traps and
bows incurred when they are used to hunt the deer and beaver.
Moreover, the prices of venison and beaver pelts will include an
element of profit that the owners of the implements are able to charge
by virtue of the scarcity of their capital stock. When the prices of
beaver pelts, venison, and traps and bows equilibrate to a level at
which trappers can purchase their consumption bundle with the
wage and at which profit rates in the various lines of production are
equalized so that all goods will be produced, it will no longer be true
that equilibrium prices of beaver pelts and venison are proportional to
the embodied labor values of beaver pelts and venison.
The deer-beaver model without capital shows why classical economists
believed there was some tendency for market prices to be proportional
to embodied labor values of commodities. This relation does
exist so long as all goods are produced without scarce capital and so
long as there are no naturally scarce and nonproduced inputs (like
land) that will command a rent, which will be a component of the
price.
Marxists also adhere to a labor theory of value because of their
belief that the real source of all value is labor. Marx a.rgued that the
one property that all commodities had in common was their production
by "abstract labor." It is hard to see why this should be regarded
as the one property that all produced commodities have in common.
They also share the property of being desired by people; and that
property gives rise to a welfare-based theory of value (which is reflected
in the statement occurring in neoclassical economic theory
that prices are proportional to marginal utilities). In fact, the labor
theory of value is a supply-side theory, in which prices are thought to
be determined entirely by their labor costs; in contrast, emphasizing
the importance of the degree to which a commodity fulfills desires or
needs or welfare in determining its price is the demand side. The
correct theory of market price must take both supply and demand
into account. There are some special cases in which demand will not
affect price, which is technologically determined, but recourse to
those cases should not be sought in an attempt to defend the labor
theory of value.
I will present one more example in order to emphasize the point
that the existence of exploitation, in the Marxist sense, has nothing to
do with the proportionality of labor values to prices. Imagine that
50 Exploitation and Profits
Andrea planted grape vines on scarce land several years ago and that
the grapes are now ready to harvest. Bob would like to consume the
wine that can be made from the grapes. Andrea expended very little
labor in planting the vines-as little as you please. (Imagine that she
only had to press a button some years ago to start the grape-growing
process.) Furthermore, assume that no more labor is needed to make
the grapes into wine today. Bob produces bread today, which requires
a good deal of current labor. He wants to trade some of his
bread for Andrea's wine, and Andrea does not want to drink her
wine on an empty stomach, so she also wants to trade. After the trade
has taken place, Bob will be consuming a bundle of bread and wine,
which together embody less labor than he expended-for, by hypothesis,
the wine embodies almost no labor. Andrea, in contrast,
worked hardly at all and consumes wine and bread that embodies a
good deal of Bob's labor. The prices at which bread and wine exchange
do not reflect the amounts of labor embodied in the two
commodities. Andrea's wine may command quite a high price relative
to Bob's bread, because no other source of wine is available for
Bob, but Andrea could produce her own daily bread by expending
the appropriate labor. One might wish to argue that Andrea is exploiting
Bob, because some of his labor has been transferred to her
(embodied in the bread), whereas he gets virtually none of her labor
in return.
In this case, the time elapsed between the planting of the grapes
and the present is like capital: although wine can be produced, it
cannot be produced quickly, and this is reflected in the price of wine.
Or, perhaps more to the point, Andrea but not Bob owns scarce land,
a circumstance that explains why Bob did not plant vines some time
ago. Note that this example is especially simple, because neither Andrea
nor Bob hires the other. Nevertheless, Andrea exploits Bob, in
the technical sense, because he expended more labor than is embodied
in the bundle of bread and wine he ends up possessing and
consuming, and she expended less labor than that embodied in what
she consumes. The transfer of labor from Bob to Andrea occurs in an
indirect fashion-through the trade of the commodities they produce-
because the prices of those commodities are not proportional
to the labor embodied in them. One might view the Andrea-Bob
economy as a precapitalist one, because the relationship of wage
labor has not yet been established. Nevertheless, the divergence of
commodity prices from labor values has emerged, because there is an
Exploitation and Profits 51
element of capital involved in the production of some goods. As long
as there is differential ownership of the capital stock used in producing
goods for consumption today, commodity prices will not generally
be proportional to labor values, and some producers will work
more hours than the hours embodied in the goods they consume
while others work fewer.
Even though Marx understood that equilibrium prices were not
generally proportional to embodied labor values in a market economy,
he made many calculations in an attempt to elucidate how labor
values could be "transformed" mathematically into equilibrium
prices. One might view this algebraic transformation problem as an
attempt to mirror the transformation of economies from simple deerbeaver
economies in which prices are proportional to labor values to
capitalist economies in which they are not. However, this line of
inquiry is not fruitful. The insights from Marxist analysis that remain
useful do not require reference to the labor theory of value, or to a
special Marxist theory of price determination. Prices are determined
by market-clearing (equilibrium) requirements, by the equating of
supply and demand.
I have referred to a stark form of the labor theory of value, which
maintains that prices are proportional to embodied labor values.
There is a looser claim advocated by some, namely, that the labor
theory of value means that embodied labor values determine equilibrium
prices, though not proportionally. Although it is hard to evaluate
such a claim, because "determination" is not as clear a relationship
as "proportionality" is, there is no interesting sense in which
this claim is true. Indeed, there is a sense in which the direction of
determination is the other way, that prices determine labor values.
Further references on this matter are given in the Bibliographical
Notes for this chapter.
Although I have verified the claim that exploitation of workers is
necessary and sufficient for positive profits, no further headway has
been made toward understanding what might be morally wrong with
exploitation. Until one can pass judgment on the morality of differential
ownership of the capital stock, it is difficult to form an opinion
about the exploitation that is its consequence. This is why I remarked
earlier that the theorems of this chapter are not so fundamental. To
make headway toward understanding the essential ethical question
requires some analysis of the conditions that lead to the exploitation
of workers, and this is the topic of the next chapter.
