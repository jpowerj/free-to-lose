# The Emergence of Class

In the models of Chapter 2, classes emerged, first, in an inessential
way when wealth was equally distributed, but then in an essential
way when the capital stock was unequally owned. In the second
model of that chapter (Section 2.3), three classes existed: capitalists,
proletarians, and peasants. In this chapter, I will elaborate more formally
on the emergence of class as a consequence of the unequal
ownership of the means of production, and I will discuss the relationship
of class to both exploitation and wealth. In the interest of simplicity,
I will use the one-dimensional com model introduced in
Chapter 3. Finally, I will evaluate what the description of an agent's
class adds to our understanding of positive and normative issues.
6.1 A Definition of Equilibrium for a Corn Model
with Assets
Consider an economy that consists, as before, of N agents and a
technology for producing com, {a,L}. This model, unlike previous
models, contains an explicit specification of the initial com endowment
of the ith agent. This endowment, cui, varies from agent to
agent. Each agent, as before, is endowed with 1 unit of leisure, which
can be converted into labor. And each agent has subsistence preferences:
each wishes to work only so long as is necessary to produce an
income sufficient to purchase an amount b of com, which I will take to
be his subsistence requirement. He will not allow himself to deplete
his initial com stock of cui. Under what conditions will this economy
reproduce itself and satisfy each agent's needs?
The Emergence of Class 73
Suppose there is a labor market. Because only relative prices matter,
the wage is normalized at I, and the price of corn is p. An agent
can engage in three kinds of activities: she can work up her own com
stock, using her own labor to produce com; she can hire others to
work up her corn stock, paying them wages; or she can sell her labor
power to others at the going wage and work up their corn stock. For
agent i, let Xi be the amount of com she produces by working up her
own seed com; let yi be the amount of com produced by those whom
she hires to work up her seed com; and let Zi be the amount of labor
she sells on the labor market. Then her total net revenues will be
(p - pa)xi + [p - (pa + L)]yi + Zi.
The first term is equal to the net revenues she receives from operating
the com activity herself; that is, revenues remaining after paying for
the com input she uses. The second term is the net revenues she
receives from hiring labor; that is, revenues remaining after paying
wages and paying for the capital stock used in the process. The third
term is her wage income. The subsistence requirement is that agent i
earn sufficient net revenues to purchase her com consumption bundle,
that is,
(p - pa)xi + [p - (pa + L)]yi + Zi 2: ph. (6.1)
What constraint does the agent's initial ownership of the capital
stock place on her? Assume that there is a labor market in this economy,
but no capital market. No agent can borrow, although she can
sell her labor power. Thus, agent i is constrained to choose levels of
com production that can be supported by the capital she has available
to advance, given her initial stock. I will assume that she need not
advance the wage payments to the labor she hires at the beginning of
the period-instead, they are paid at the end of the period out of
revenues. (This assumption differs from the one I made in Chapter 4,
and I make it here only because it simplifies some of the calculations.)
Under this assumption, the amount of finance capital agent i must
have in order to operate corn production at level Xi herself and hire
others to operate it at level yi is paxi + payi. Her capital constraint is
paxi + payi !5 poi. (6.2)
Furthermore, agent i is constrained not to use more labor than she
possesses:
(6.3)
74 The Emergence of Class
The first term in (6.3) is the amount of labor agent i expends on her
own com stock, and the second term is the amount of labor she sells
on the labor market. The right-hand side of (6.3) is her labor endowment.
The goal of agent i is to minimize the labor she expends subject to
producing a subsistence income and subject to satisfying her capital
constraint (6.2) and labor constraint (6.3). Her utility maximization
problem can therefore be written as, choose Xi, yi, and Zi to
minimize Lxi + Zi
subject to (p - pa)xi + [p - (pa + L)]yi + Zi ~ pb
paxi + payi :s; pwi
Lxi + Zi :s; 1
(6.1)
(6.2)
(6.3)
and subject to the constraint that the variables Xi, yi, and Zi are
nonnegative.
Call this optimization problem for the agent i, (Pi).
In this economy there are N agents, each of whom is trying to solve
a program of the type (Pi). Such an economy is in equilibrium if the
markets dear. In other words, a wage-price of com, p, will equilibrate
the economy if it allows the markets to clear. There are two markets:
one for com and one for labor. The com market clears if the net
amount of com produced suffices to meet the demand for com,
which is Nb; and the labor market clears if the total supply of labor
offered for sale by the N agents equals the total demand for hired
labor by the N agents.
To represent these conditions, it is first convenient to define
where x is the total amount of com, gross, produced by agents working
for themselves, y is the total amount of com produced by agents
who are working as hired labor, and z is the total labor supplied on
the labor market. The total amount of com produced in this economy,
without taking account of replacing the seed stock, is (x + y); the net
com production is (1 - a)(x + y). Hence, the requirement that the
supply of com, net of replacement, meet the demand for com is
(1 - a)(x + y) ~ Nb. (6.4)
The Emergence of Class 75
As defined above, the total supply of labor offered for sale is z; and
the total demand for labor by hirers is Ly. Thus, the labor market
clears if
Ly = z. (6.5)
Finally, the production plan of this economy must be feasible, which
is to say that the total inputs society has available, w == ~wi, suffice to
supply the inputs for the outputs generated; that is,
a(x + y) :5 w. (6.6)
Definition 6.1 Reproducible Equilibrium A price for corn of p(and a
wage of 1) will be said to be a reproducible equilibrium for this economy
if the solutions {(Xi,yi,Zi)} to the individual optimization programs
(Pi) generated by this price are such that the aggregate quantities
x, y, and z satisfy Equations (6.4), (6.5), and (6.6).
To summarize, each agent begins with some initial endowment of
seed corn. There is a corn market and a labor market. Facing a price
for corn and a wage, each agent decides on his best strategy, which
will enable him to earn the income necessary for purchasing his required
corn consumption while not running down his seed corn
stock. This strategy is his labor-minimizing one, because I have assumed
that the agents have subsistence preferences. An equilibrium
is a price of corn, relative to the wage, having the property that, if
each agent pursues his self-interest in this way, markets clear; every
individual plan can be realized, and society can reproduce its capital
stock.
6.2 Class Formation
As a consequence of their optimizing behavior and their initial endowments,
agents end up in different class positions. Hence, by this
mechanism, classes are formed.
Facing a price of corn p, an agent solves his program (Pi) with a
solution (Xi,yi,Zi). Suppose, for example, that for him the optimum
involves setting Xi = 0 = Zi (neither does he himself work up any of
his seed corn, nor does he sell labor power) but yi > 0 (he hires labor
76 The Emergence of Class
power to work up his seed capital). He can be represented as having a
solution vector of the form (0, + ,0), where a "0" in a certain place
indicates that he does not engage in that kind of activity and a "+"
indicates that he does. The agent in this example is a pure capitalist,
because he optimizes by hiring labor power only; he neither sells
labor power nor works for himself. Suppose that another agent's
solution to his program involves setting Xi = Â° = yi, but Zi > O. Such a
person is represented as having a solution (0,0, +): he is a proletarian,
who optimizes by selling labor power only-he neither works for
himself nor hires labor power.
Definition 6.2 Class Position The class position of an agent is defined
by the particular array of D's and +'s in the optimal solution (Xi,yi,Zi)
to his program (Pi) at a reproducible equilibrium.
In principle, there are eight possible ways of arranging D's and +'s in
the three positions of (x,y,z). But one of them can be ruled out immediately:
everyone must earn some income to purchase his consumption
bundle in this economy, because no one is willing to eat into his
capital stock; so the class position (0,0,0) will never occur as a solution.
Furthermore, it is not difficult to show that no agent will ever be
required both to sell labor and to hire labor at the same time in order
to optimize-every agent has an optimal solution in which he does
not trade as both a supplier and a demander of labor. This rules out
the class positions (0, + ,+) and (+ ,+ ,+) as redundant in a parsimonious
representation of the class structure of this economy. There remain
five possible class positions; and they all can occur and should
be named (Table 6.1). I have assigned both industrial and agricultural
names to these classes, for the value these may have as historical
mnemonics. The reader should verify that each of these class positions
corresponds naturally to the name that identifies it.

The Emergence of Class 77
How is an agent's class position related to his wealth and how is it
related to his being either exploited or exploiting? The important idea
to keep in mind during the following analysis is that a person's class
position is not exogenously given. Rather, it emerges as a consequence
of his optimizing procedure, which is to maximize his utility
(in this case, minimize labor expended subject to a subsistence constraint)
given his initial endowment. Classes emerge endogenously as
a characteristic of agents in the equilibrium of the economy.
6.3 Class and Wealth
In this economy wages are paid at the end of the period, so the capital
advanced to produce 1 unit of com is just pa. The equation defining
the profit rate is
1T = P - (pa + wL)
pa '
or
p = (1 + 1T)pa + wL. (6.7)
Equation (6.7) differs from the formulation of the profit rate in Chapter
4 only in that investment capital does not include wages advanced.
As I mentioned there, it is a matter of convention whether
one chooses to view wages as paid in advance out of capital or at the
end of the production period out of revenues, for the results with
which I am concerned do not change.
Class is related to wealth in the way one might conjecture: the
greater an agent's initial endowment of com, the higher he is on the
class hierarchy listed in Section 6.2. The richest agents become pure
capitalists and the poorest become proletarians.
Theorem 6.1 Class-Wealth Correspondence The greater an agent's
initial endowment of com, the "higher" he is on the class hierarchy of
Table 6.1.
Proof.
1. Let the profit rate, which I assume is positive, be 1T. At the price
p, the value of an agent's initial wealth is
(6.8)
78 The Emergence of Class
If an agent is sufficiently wealthy, then he clearly can generate
enough revenue, simply from hiring others to work for him, to end
up with profits of at least pb, which is what he requires. Thus, all
those whose wealth is sufficiently great will only hire others; they will
be in the class of pure capitalists, as they will neither sell labor power
nor work for themselves. This establishes that those at the top of the
wealth hierarchy belong to the class (0,+,0), as Theorem 6.1 claims.
2. It is similarly clear that the agents who are pure proletarians are
precisely those who own zero corn at the beginning. For if an agent
had some initial wealth, he could derive profits of 7TWi from hiring
others to work it, thus reducing his own necessary work time. It
would be wasteful not to use capital he owned. No such agent would,
therefore, be a proletarian. Conversely, if an agent owns no corn but
only labor power, then his only source of revenues is to sell his labor
power; and he optimizes by taking the class position (0,0,+). Hence,
those in the class position (0,0,+) are precisely those with zero
wealth.
3. It remains to rank by wealth agents who optimize by becoming
members of the three "middle classes." These are agents who have
some wealth. Let an optimal solution for such an agent i be (Xi,yi,Zi).
An agent with some wealth, but not enough to be a pure capitalist,
must necessarily engage all his capital in production to optimize, for
otherwise he would make more revenue by hiring some labor to
operate his unused capital, because 7T > O. Therefore, constraint (6.2)
of the agent's program is an equality, and dividing through by pa
yields
. . wi
Xl + yl =_.
a
4. Constraint (6.1) of agent i's program can be rewritten as
p(l - a)(xi + yi) + (Zi - Lyi) = pb.
Substituting from (6.9) into (6.1') yields
p(l - a)wi
~-~ + (Zi - Lyi) = pb.

From (6.10), a rearrangement of terms gives
[ (1 - a)wi ]
Zi - Lyi = P b - a '

from which it follows that

(6.11b)
(6.11c)
5. From the inequalities of (6.11), the rest of the Class-Wealth
Correspondence can be derived. Suppose Zi - Lyi = 0; that is, agent i
optimizes by selling exactly as much labor power as he hires to work
on his own capital stock. Now observe that he could fire all his hired
labor and instead work up the capital they were using himself in the
same amount of time (by hypothesis), and he would just break even.
He would save wages paid out in amount Lyi by firing them, and he
would lose wages paid to him in amount Zi by taking himself off the
labor market; and these two amounts are equal, by the supposition of
this paragraph. Thus, he could just as well operate all his capital
himself, neither hiring nor selling labor; and he would make the same
revenues for the same amount of labor expended. This shows that if
. ba
w'=--
1 - a' (6.12)
then agent i is a petty bourgeois artisan; he has a solution to his
program of the form < + ,0,0). And, according to (6.11b), the wealth
given by (6.12) is precisely the wealth associated with Zi - Lyi = 0.
6. Now suppose Zi - Lyi < 0. Then agent i is hiring more labor
power than he expends on the labor market. He cannot, therefore,
fire all his hired labor and simply replace them with his own labor in
the same amount. If he takes himself off the labor market, he can fire
some of his hired labor, but to break even in terms of labor expended
and revenues earned he must continue to hire labor in the amount
(Lyi - Zi). Therefore, such an agent is in the class < +, + ,D)-he can
optimize by working on his own capital stock and hiring others.
According to (6.11a), this agent has a wealth

himself work up the capital stock they were employed upon, but he
must still supply wage labor to earn the revenues he was making
before. He must continue to sell some of his labor power on the labor
market, and his class position is therefore (+,0,+). According to
(6.l1c), this agent has wealth

(6.14)
8. The arguments in paragraphs 5, 6, and 7 establish that agents in
the three middle classes are ranked according to their wealths; only
agents with wealth exactly equal to bal(1 - a) are petty bourgeois
artisans, and those with higher wealth must hire labor to optimize
while those with lower wealth must sell labor to optimize. This demonstration
establishes the Class-Wealth Correspondence. -
Table 6.2 summarizes the relationships between class and wealth
given in the proof of Theorem 6.1. Thus, only the proletarian has
nothing to sell but his labor power-and nothing to lose but his
chains.
I must reiterate that this relationship between class and wealth is
not one that is postulated initially; it emerges as a consequence of
economic activity. Agents choose their own class position-not willingly,
but under constraint, as a consequence of optimizing, given their
initial endowments. Theorem 6.1 demonstrates that the relationship
between class and wealth need not be postulated-it can be derived
under the assumption that maximizing agents confront one another

in a system of private property and markets. The phenomena of class
and exploitation are not residues of market imperfections but are the
consequences of a "perfect" market system, where agents are free to
choose, constrained by their initial endowments of wealth and labor
power.
As a historical note, it is worth mentioning that when Lenin wrote
The Development of Capitalism in Russia he discussed the class structure
in the Russian countryside:
In the peasant mass of 97 million, however, one must distinguish
three main groups: the bottom group-the proletarian and semi-proletarian
strata of the population; the middle-the poor small peasant
farmers; and the top group-the well-to-do small peasant farmers.
We have analyzed above the main economic features of these groups
as distinct class elements. The bottom group is the propertyless population,
which earns its livelihood mainly, or half of it, by the sale of
labour power. The middle group comprises the poor small peasant
farmers, for the middle peasant in the best of years just barely manages
to make ends meet, but the principal means of livelihood of this
group is "independent" (supposedly independent, of course) smallscale
farming. Finally, the top group consists of the well-to-do small
peasant farmers, who exploit more or less considerable numbers of
allotment-holding farm labourers and day labourers and all sorts of
wage-labourers in general. (Lenin, 1899 [1974, p. 508])
Richer than all these peasants, and not discussed in this paragraph
from Lenin, were the landlords, who did not work at all by virtue of
owning so much land.
Similarly, Mao Zedong, in his pamphlet "Analysis of the Classes in
Chinese Society," wrote:
Although both the overwhelming majority of the semi-owner peasants
and the poor peasants belong to the semi-proletariat, they may
be further divided into three smaller categories, upper, middle and
lower, according to their economic condition. The semi-owner peasants
are worse off than the owner-peasants because every year they
are short of about half the food they need, and have to make up this
deficit by renting land from others, selling part of their labor power,
or engaging in petty trading. In late spring and early summer when
the crop is still in the blade and the old stock is consumed, they
borrow at exorbitant rates of interest and buy grain at high prices;
their plight is naturally harder than that of the owner-peasants who
need no help from others, but they are better off than the poor peas82
The Emergence of Class
ants. For the poor peasants own no land, and receive only half the
harvest or even less for their year's toil, while the semi-owner peasants,
though receiving only half or less than half the harvest of land
rented from others, can keep the entire crop from the land they own.
The semi-owner peasants are therefore more revolutionary than the
owner-peasants, but less revolutionary than the poor peasants. (Mao,
1926 [1974, pp. 16-17])
Mao refers to borrowing and lending, which is not part of the
model of this chapter-but I will show later that his identification of
borrowing with the selling of labor power and lending with the hiring
of labor power is borne out. Moreover, he makes some sociological
observations about the revolutionary nature of the peasantry as a
function of their wealth, a topic that I have not discussed. The salient
point is that the model of this chapter seems to capture aspects of
historical observation. Textual analysis of Lenin's statement reveals
that he is discussing the lower four classes in the five-class hierarchy
of my model, whereas Mao discu.sses only the bottom three. He does
not make explicit mention of rich peasants who systematically hire
labor, or lend money, or rent land to others.
6.4 Class and Exploitation
I have identified class position with wealth in an unambiguous way.
But how is class position related to exploitation?
Theorem 6.2 Class-Exploitation Correspondence Agents who optimize
by placing themselves in a labor-hiring class are exploiters, and
agents who optimize by selling labor are exploited.
Proof. Consider the agent who has wealth that puts him in the petty
bourgeois artisan class; his wealth (Equation 6.12) is wi = ba/(l - a).
He must utilize all his capital, for otherwise he could earn more
revenue by hiring some labor to use his excessive capital and thereby
reduce his own work time further. Therefore, if his optimal solution is
(xi,O,O), it must be the case that
. . ba
ax' = w' = -- or 1 - a' (6.15)

. b
X, = -1 --aÂ· (6.15')
Hence, the amount of time he works is
. bL
Lx' = -- = Ab = SNLT
1 - a ' (6.16)
the last equation following because the labor value of corn, A, is equal
to L/(1 - a). Equation (6.16) says that agent i works just socially
necessary labor time.
Now consider an agent j, who is richer than agent i. By Theorem
6.1, agent j must be in a labor-hiring class; and an agent who is richer
than agent i will work less time than i works, because his object is to
minimize time worked subject only to his wealth constraint and the
subsistence constraint. Thus, agent j works less time than Ab and is
consequently an exploiter. Similarly, consider an agent k, who is
poorer than agent i; agent k will be in a labor-selling class, by Theorem
6.1, and will work more time than Ab. Hence, k is exploited.
Thus, every agent in a labor-hiring class works less than the socially
necessary labor time, and every agent in a labor-selling class works
longer than the socially necessary labor time. This establishes Theorem
6.2 .â¢
Both the exploitation and class status of an agent emerge as endogenous
characteristics of agents in the equilibrium of this economy;
they are not postulated from the start. Hence, the Class-Exploitation
Correspondence is not an obvious fact, because it relates two properties
of an individual, both of which emerge as the consequence of
economic activity. In the one-good model, Theorem 6.2 is very easy to
prove; in a model with many goods, it remains true but is more
difficult to prove. Furthermore, the characterization is not quite so
neat. In a model with many goods (like the one of Section 4.3), there
is a range of wealths associated with being in the class (+,0,0), not
just one number, as there is here. The generalization of Theorem 6.2
to many goods states that any agent in the top two classes is an
exploiter and any agent in the bottom two classes is exploited, but it is
not the case that all agents in the middle artisan class are exploitationneutral,
as in the one-good model. The precise identification of exploitation
status with class status, as shown here, is an artifact of the onegood
model.
84 The Emergence of Class
With Theorems 6.1 and 6.2 I have established a wealth-exploitation
correspondence. Table 6.2 shows that any agent whose wealth is
greater than a certain amount [Wi> ba/(l - a)] is an exploiter and any
agent whose wealth is less than a certain amount [wi < ba/(l - a)] is
exploited.
In this chapter I have adopted two major simplifications that one
might wish to relax in a more general model. First, one should allow
for an economy with many goods; second, one should allow for
agents to have more complicated preferences than the subsistence
preferences they have in this model. And it is necessary to consider
how to define exploitation when people have more complicated preferences.
Nevertheless, when the model is generalized in this way,
Theorem 6.2 remains true.
Suppose people have various preferences over goods and leisure,
they engage in economic activity to earn income, and they purchase
goods. In this case the general definition of exploitation is as follows:
an agent is exploited if the labor he expends in economic activity is
greater than the labor that is embodied in any bundle of goods he could
purchase with his revenues, that is, if any commodity bundle within his
budget embodies less labor than he expended. Similarly, an agent is
defmed as an exploiter if all bundles of goods that can be purchased
with his total revenues from production embody more labor than he
expended. This definition allows for the possibility of a significant
group of agents who are neither exploited nor exploiters, because the
revenues they earn from production enable them to buy a commodity
bundle embodying just the amount of labor they expended (although
they will not necessarily purchase just that bundle). The Class-Exploitation
Correspondence theor,em states that any agent who optimizes
by being in a labor-hiring class is an exploiter and any agent
who optimizes by being in a labor-selling class is exploited. This is the
generalization of Theorem 6.2, and it remains true in the framework
of arbitrary preferences and many goods.
Does the Class-Wealth Correspondence remain true with general
preferences and many goods? Not always. If preferences of agents are
bizarre in a certain way (see Chapter 9), then the relationship between
class and wealth can fail. This happens only for preferences
that are quite unusual. When it happens, the relationship between
wealth and exploitation fails as well, for wealth is related to exploitation
status by virtue of the class-wealth and class-exploitation correspondences.
The consequences will be discussed in Chapter 9.
The Emergence of Class 85
6.S The Significance of Class
Classes are important in the Marxist theory of historical materialism;
class struggle is the midwife of social revolution, the instrument by
which property relations are transformed in radical ways-from feudalism
to capitalism, from capitalism to socialism. Now that a theory
of class formation has been formulated, it is possible to comment
briefly on why classes might be interesting and why class struggle is
apparently so prevalent, at least in the Marxist theory of history.
Theorems 6.1 and 6.i immediately suggest two answers to the
question, "Why is there class struggle?" First, the fight of the working
classes against the capitalist class may just be a fight of poor
against rich, a fight against the consequences of unequal initial distribution.
This position is suggested by the Class-Wealth Correspondence.
Or perhaps there is some underlying reason why the exploited
should fight the exploiters-this position is associated with the
Class-Exploitation Correspondence. There is a third factor that might
motivate class struggle: conflict between the dominated and those
who dominate. I refer to the domination by the employer of the
worker at the point of production, the social relations in the workplace,
in which the worker's subservience to the boss is enforced by
various extraeconomic means, which I referred to earlier. These three
explanations can be labeled, respectively, the wealth, exploitation, and
domination accounts of class struggle.
How sensible is the explanation that class struggle arises by virtue
of the association of class with exploitation as such? That is, do the
exploited classes fight the exploiting classes because they can only
purchase consumption bundles embodying less labor then they expended
in production? I find this account unconvincing. One of the
central points of Chapter 4 was that relations of exploitation are obscured
by commodity relations and the social division of labor under
capitalism. Workers are not so conscious of their exploitation under
capitalist property relations. They may feel unfairly taken advantage
of, but not by virtue of comparing the socially necessary labor time
they consume in goods with the labor they expend. Theorem 6.1 says
that class is a good statistic for exploitation, but one cannot use exploitation
as an explanation of class struggle unless it is perceived by the
workers as an injustice they wish to erase. It is hard to make this case,
when one simultaneously wishes to claim that capitalist relations obscure
relations of exploitation.
86 The Emergence of Class
Of course, to the extent that workers fight for a higher wage, or for
a shorter length of the working day for the same wage, they are de
facto fighting against exploitation, for victories in those struggles will
lower the rate of exploitation (at least in the short run). But in those
cases workers are fighting not against their exploitation as such, but
because they want a higher real income or more humane conditions
of work.
It is much more likely that workers struggle against capitalists in
part because of the methods of control that are used against them in
the workplace, to extract their labor. This struggle takes the form of
fighting about the conditions of work. Fights against speedup and the
methods used to implement it are an example. The fight against domination
has been institutionalized in the American trade union movement,
with careful delineation of job rules that prevent the employer
from having the freedom to use workers in arbitrary ways; these rules
are the consequence of an attempt to limit the arbitrary power of
employers to extract labor from labor power on the job. I do not claim
that all struggles for better conditions on the job are struggles against
domination; but capitalists do use extraeconomic coercion of workers
to squeeze more labor out of a day's labor power, a squeezing
that often has exhausting and harrowing consequences for the
worker.
Why is there extraeconomic coercion, or domination, by foremen
over workers on the job? The ultra-neoclassical explanation is similar
to the North-Thomas explanation for feudal coercion. Recall that the
serf was said to have implicitly agreed to a contract with the lord
under which he was forced to work, and public goods that otherwise
would not have been available were provided. A weaker version of
the explanation claims that even if the serf did not so agree, provision
of otherwise unavailable public goods was the upshot of feudal coercion.
Similarly, if the worker does not work on the job, then profits
fall and workers are fired. Thus, the story goes, workers implicitly
contract with employers to have themselves coerced on the job, because
otherwise in their myopia they would not work as hard as is
necessary to produce the revenues sufficient to pay the wages they
want.
I do not think the implicit contract explanation of job-site domination
is credible. Rather, such domination exists because of the impossibility
of writing and enforcing a perfect contract for the exchange of
labor for the wage. What the capitalist buys is the worker's capacity to

work for a day. But it is not easy to delineate his tasks precisely nor to
enforce their execution. This difficulty gives rise to a range of acceptable
performances: naturally, the capitalist tries to get workers to
perform at one end of this range, and if that involves pain and tension,
the worker resists.
There is also another explanation offered by Marxists for jobsite
domination, in which its place is more central in the maintenance
of capitalist property relations. Such domination is said to be a
method by which the capitalist exerts power over the worker and
demoralizes her, keeping her in a subservient position from
which it becomes difficult to challenge either the individual boss
through collective action on the job or the capitalist system more
generally. Domination breaks down the worker's ability and will
to resist (a claim that I do not find compelling), and because of that
its role is much more central in the maintenance of capitalism than
the one assigned to it in the imperfect-contract argument just presented.
Is it plausible to argue that class struggle is a direct attack on the
wealth differential of capitalists and workers? Certainly the most revolutionary
struggles are just that-the working class supporting a call
for a massive redistribution of private property or an end to the institution
of private property. In our times, this call is typical of the
great socialist revolutions. One Soviet slogan of 1917 was "Bread,
Land, and Peace." "Land" meant redistribution of land to the peasants.
A Chinese slogan was "Land to the tiller." Indeed, socialist
revolutions have gone much further than redistributing private
property; they have abolished private property in the means of production.
In less generalized struggles, such as strikes, it is not plausible to
argue that class struggle attacks the wealth differential of capitalists
and workers. Trade union struggles do not call for such a redistribution,
they only call for better wages and working conditions. Indeed,
Marxists have often characterized trade union class struggle as "economist,"
because it is limited to relatively parochial economic demands
instead of taking on the basis of the inequality, the system of private
property in the means of production. This is not to say that Marxists
oppose trade union struggles, but that they do not view them as
necessarily leading to the revolutionary transformation that would be
necessary to end the class system and the inequality that lies at its
foundation.
88 The Emergence of Class
The working class may sometimes become an important historical
actor by virtue of the consciousness created among workers of their
power, consciousness that arises as a result of the conditions of capitalist
production. The factory system brings together many workers
and teaches them to work in a disciplined, coordinated fashion in one
place. It creates both relations of cooperation among workers and a
conception of their power that were lacking in the small-scale private
production characteristic of the putting-out system or of artisan work.
Having this consciousness, workers see the possibility of changing
their conditions through collective action. According to this explanation
of class struggle, the combination of having "nothing to lose but
one's chains" and being educated with respect to the potential collective
power of the class is a by-product of the nature of capitalist
production and enables the working class to fight. Thus, although
capitalists may dominate workers in order to demoralize them, the
demoralization does not always succeed because of the nature of the
industrial (or capitalist?) labor process, which reveals to workers their
power and potential.
Class struggle takes place only when the members of the working
class see a potential for victory. The costs of fighting are too great for
an individual, even in a collective mass where he is relatively anonymous,
unless there is some expectation of victory. (I do not refer here
to the free-rider problem of collective action, in which it is maintained
that even if conditions are very bad it is not in the interest of any
individual to join a collective struggle. That is a distinct theoretical
issue.) It is a classic observation that the absolutely poorest-the
unemployed and completely marginalized members of society-are
not the most revolutionary. People must have some vision of their
power, and this is provided, in the Marxist account, by their class
relation to one another, the discipline and cooperation that is a byproduct
of capitalist production. Marginalized individuals do not
achieve this vision because of their isolation from the cooperative
enterprise of capitalist production.
There are, then, a variety of sociological and psychological reasons,
as well as economic ones, for believing that classes, as 1 have defined
them, are important social actors. The economic reason is chiefly the
relation of class to wealth. The sociological and psychological reasons
are the relations of class to domination, power, discipline, and consciousness.
Consciousness, in turn, is determined by the common
experiences that members of the same class have, both in production
and in consumption.
The Emergence of Class 89
6.6 Exploitation Deemphasized
Two characteristics of agents have emerged as important to positive
and normative concerns: wealth and class. What is surprising is that
exploitation, in the technical sense, seems to have fallen out of the
picture. Differential initial wealth is of normative interest, as Chapter
5 emphasized, because it may well be the central injustice of a capitalist
system, by virtue of the unequal opportunities that it creates.
Differential wealth is also of positive significance, to the extent that it
explains social rebellion and the transformation of systems of property.
But it is more likely that differential wealth works indirectly
through the formation of classes. Class is of interest as a positive
statistic of class struggle, and hence of social transformation; the reasons
for class struggle may not be directly related to the wealth associated
with class position but with the consciousness that comes about
by virtue of common class membership. But although exploitation is
related to both class and wealth, it does not appear to be of direct
interest from either the positive or the normative viewpoint. If workers
are unfairly taken advantage of, it is not because they are exploited
(in the technical sense) but because an unfair wealth distribution
produces that exploitation as a by-product; and if workers unite
in class struggle, it is not because they are exploited as such, but for
the other reasons I have given. Exploitation, in the technical Marxist
sense, appears to be an unnecessary appendage to our basic concerns,
both ethical and positive.
To put this bluntly, some central concepts of classical Marxist economics-
the labor theory of value and exploitation-seem not to be
of fundamental interest. Analysis with economic tools reveals that
much work remains for Marxist ethics and for sociology and history,
the first to study the moral legitimacy of private property in the
means of production, the second to study the usefulness of class as an
explanation for the formation of attitudes and preferences and, ultimately,
for the collective action that transforms society. What the
economic analysis shows is that class position can be explained endogenously,
as the consequence of initial differentiation in wealth,
and that the technical notion of exploitation is closely related to the
two more fundamental measures, class and wealth. In Section 9.2
further evidence will be presented for the position that exploitation
(always in the technical Marxist sense) does not provide the best
measure of the injustice associated with differential ownership of the
means of production.
